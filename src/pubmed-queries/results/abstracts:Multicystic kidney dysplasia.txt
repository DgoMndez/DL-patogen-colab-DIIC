With the advent of routine prenatal imaging, the number of renal anomalies 
identified prenatally has significantly increased; however, the underlying 
etiologies of these anomalies and the clinical significance of these findings 
remains unclear. This confusion is especially true for the prenatal diagnosis of 
cystic renal changes. The terms "cystic kidney disease" and "renal cystic 
dysplasia" encompass myriad renal diseases. Although renal cystic dysplasia in 
infants shares many similarities with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), it 
is important to distinguish MCDK from other etiologies that would lead to renal 
cysts, to ensure proper patient diagnosis and appropriate counseling regarding 
risks and to guide clinical management. The purpose of this review is to 
highlight the multiple etiologies of cystic kidney disease, including genetic 
associations, associations with underlying syndromes, and associations with 
underlying anatomical abnormalities. Here we focus on prenatal imaging, 
associated pathological findings, and clinical significance, with an emphasis on 
the defining characteristics of MCDK as compared to other forms of cystic renal 
disease.

INTRODUCTION: Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK) is a common cause of palpable 
abdominal mass in a neonate, yet reports are few of resultant life-threatening 
extrinsic compression. This systematic review is the first to review all known 
neonatal MCDK cases complicated by external compression due to mass effect. Our 
aim is to foster communication about these unusual cases to inform management of 
future comparable cases.
METHODS: This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Medical Subject 
Headings (MeSH) were used to search PubMed through June 8, 2021 as follows: 
((((Polycystic Kidney Diseases/complications [MeSH Terms]) OR (Multicystic 
Dysplastic Kidney/complications [MeSH Terms])) AND (Humans [MeSH Terms]) AND 
(Infant, Newborn [MeSH Terms]) AND (Case Reports [Publication Type]) AND 
(("multicystic dysplastic kidney") OR ("multicystic kidney")))) OR ((unusual 
respiratory distress in newborn [Title]) AND (kidney)) OR (large MCDK). 
Resulting papers were screened and included if they reported neonatal MCDK 
complicated by external compression by mass effect. Excluded papers lacked an 
MCDK diagnosis, a neonatal patient, or clear indication of mass effect. Salient 
data was extracted from each case for comparison.
RESULTS: Of 51 papers screened, seven met inclusion criteria, presenting eight 
neonatal MCDK patients exhibiting varied combinations of symptoms secondary to 
external compression, including respiratory distress, gastrointestinal 
obstruction, and contralateral ureteral obstruction. All eight cases, ultimately 
managed with neonatal nephrectomy, had positive outcomes. Unreported and 
undiagnosed cases are not included in this review, making it susceptible to 
publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Large neonatal MCDK is typically managed conservatively, however it 
can be complicated by external compression due to mass effect. In this scenario, 
nephrectomy is a reasonable and definitive treatment. Less invasive management 
options may exist, e.g., aspiration with sclerotherapy. Communication about 
exceptional cases like these should be encouraged even when outcomes are poor.

Update on Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is the most common cause of cystic disease 
in children. It is characterized by multiple non-communicating cysts of varying 
sizes with no identifiable normal renal parenchyma. The incidence ranges from 1 
in 1000 to 4300 live births, and it is one of the most commonly detected 
anomalies on prenatal ultrasound. MCDK has been shown to follow a benign course 
with relatively few sequelae and therefore should be managed conservatively. 
Currently, the key clinical questions revolve around the detection of anomalies 
in the contralateral kidney and follow-up imaging. The recent literature 
suggests that very limited radiographic evaluation of the MCDK is needed. The 
use of voiding cystourethrogram or nuclear medicine renal scans should be 
directed by any abnormalities on renal ultrasound or the development of urinary 
tract infections.

A 2-month-old child presented for evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis. Imaging 
studies were consistent with a right duplex system with a dysplastic, 
nonfunctioning upper pole and lower pole ureteropelvic junction obstruction. We 
proceeded with removal of the upper pole and pyeloplasty and were surprised to 
find a single collecting system with a cystic, dysplastic upper pole segment and 
the absence of an upper pole pelvis or ureter. The rare diagnosis of a segmental 
multicystic dysplastic kidney with ipsilateral ureteropelvic junction 
obstruction was made. We present a review of the case and of previous literature 
on this topic.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the prenatal growth pattern of the normal kidney 
contralateral to a multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK).
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a single referral center over 
4 years. Cases diagnosed prenatally as MCDK and confirmed postnatally 
constituted the study group. For creation of nomograms, only isolated cases of 
MCDK were included.
RESULTS: Sixty-one fetuses had a diagnosis of an MCDK during the study period. 
After exclusion of cases with associated malformations, 47 fetuses remained, 
providing 94 measurements for creation of nomograms. The growth pattern of the 
normal kidney contralateral to an MCDK was linear throughout gestation 
(percentile = 20.01 + 1.5 gestational age; linear R2  = 0.753; r = 0.868) and 
was significantly higher during the third trimester (29-38 weeks' gestation) 
compared to the second trimester (22-28 weeks' gestation; P < .001). A 
comparison of the growth pattern of the normal kidney contralateral to the MCDK 
to the growth pattern of a solitary kidney revealed a significant higher 
compensatory trend during the third trimester (P < .0001). The mean kidney 
lengths at 22 and 38 weeks' gestation correlated with the 52nd and 88th and with 
the 84th and 90th percentiles for the normal kidney contralateral to the MCDK 
and a solitary kidney, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, the normal kidney contralateral to an MCDK 
has a unique growth pattern during intrauterine life, with dominant growth 
during the third trimester. The exact mechanism for this pattern, in comparison 
to early renal hypertrophy shown in solitary kidneys, is currently not clear. 
These data provide relevant information for the multidisciplinary prenatal 
counseling of future parents regarding the future renal outcome.

OBJECTIVE: Multicystic dysplastic kidney is a relatively common developmental 
abnormality in infants and children. Additional abnormalities like 
vesicoureteral reflux, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and ureterovesical 
junction obstruction may accompany multicystic dysplastic kidney. In this 
article, we reviewed the pathogenesis, diagnosis, associated urinary tract 
anomalies and results of management of multicystic dysplastic kidney in the 
light of the literature.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: We retrospectively assessed 20 children with unilateral 
multicystic dysplastic kidney between January 2005 and December 2009. Mean 
duration of follow-up was 35 ± 8.7 months. All children with multicystic 
dysplastic kidney underwent nephrectomy. Patient characteristics, the pathology 
findings, associated urinary tract anomalies and results of management were 
reviewed.
RESULTS: Abdominal ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography and renal scintigraphy 
revealed vesicoureteral reflux in 3 (15%) children, ureteropelvic junction 
obstruction in 3 (15%) children, and a duplex system in the contralateral kidney 
in 1 (5%) child. Blood pressure values, serum urea, creatinine and urinalysis 
were within normal range in all children during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: A conservative approach to children with multicystic dysplastic 
kidney has been advocated, but surgical removal is also another management 
modality on the basis of risk of hypertension, mass effect, potential for 
malignant change, and cost of repeated ultrasound examination.

Non-surgical management of multicystic dysplastic kidney.

Cambio AJ(1), Evans CP, Kurzrock EA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, University of California, Davis School of Medicine, 
Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To better define the outcome and association of multicystic 
dysplastic kidney (MCDK) with hypertension, vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR), 
infection and cancer, as there is no consensus on the management of patients 
born with MCDK. The risk of cancer has dictated the surgical management of the 
disease in the past.
METHODS: The Medline database was searched for articles published between 1965 
and 2006 and written in the English language, and containing the keywords 
'multicystic dysplastic kidney'.
RESULTS: The inclusion criteria were met by 105 reports that were subsequently 
analysed. Of MCDK, 60% regress or involute within 3 years. About 25% of patients 
will have VUR into the contralateral kidney, of which 90% is grade <or=3. The 
risk of urinary tract infection appears to be associated with VUR or coexistent 
abnormalities rather than the MCDK. The risk of hypertension is no greater than 
that in the general population and nephrectomy is usually not curative. The 
overall risk of Wilms' tumour developing in a MCDK is <1 in 2000. All reported 
Wilms' tumours were identified before 4 years of age and 70% presented as a 
palpable mass.
CONCLUSIONS: Published reports support the non-surgical management of MCDK. 
Common practice has been to remove palpable or growing MCDKs, although these 
represent a very small fraction of MCDKs. In theory, ultrasonographic 
surveillance until 4 years old might allow the earlier detection of a Wilms' 
tumour, and decrease the intensity of chemotherapy and improve prognosis. 
Previous reports do not prove or disprove this concept, and the appropriate 
frequency of surveillance is not evident.

Multicystic renal dysplasia.

Nagaraj VP(1), Ratnakar KS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pathology, Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain.

Multicystic renal dysplasia, the most common form of cystic renal disease in the 
newborn period, is a clinically important consequence of abnormal nephrogenesis. 
It usually presents as an abdominal mass. The dysplasias are usually unilateral, 
but it can be bilateral, segmental or focal. The clinical presentation usually 
depends on the extent of the dysplastic involvement and the degree of the 
associated urinary obstruction. Here, we present a case of histologically 
multicystic renal dysplasia, which is ?bilateral. The left kidney showed typical 
radiological, gross and histopathological features of multicystic dysplasia, but 
the right kidney showed only radiological features of dysplastic cystic kidney.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the prenatal diagnosis and 
epidemiology of multicystic kidney dysplasia (MCKD).
METHODS: The study is based on routinely collected data from a European database 
of major congenital anomalies including 13 registries with cases born in 
1997-2006 and covering 1 458 552 births.
RESULTS: There were 601 MCKD cases giving an overall prevalence of 4.12 per 
10 000 births with regional variation. In live births, 87% of cases had an 
isolated renal anomaly and 13% had associated major nonrenal anomalies 
(chromosomal, syndrome or other major anomalies). For the cases with isolated 
renal anomalies, 51/386 (11%) and 7/386 (2%) choose to terminate the pregnancy 
or resulted in an intrauterine fetal death, respectively. The prenatal detection 
rate was 88% in both unilateral and bilateral cases. Birth outcome differed with 
92% of unilateral MCKD cases being liveborn compared with 33% of bilateral MCKD 
cases. For unilateral MCKD cases, 84% had an isolated renal anomaly compared 
with 51% of bilateral MCKD cases (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cases with unilateral MCKD are mainly liveborn, and only 16% have 
associated major malformations or a syndrome. Cases with bilateral MCKD are 
often associated with nonrenal major congenital anomalies or part of a syndrome, 
and only one third of bilateral MCKD cases in this study were liveborn. Prenatal 
detection rate of MCKD was high for both unilateral and bilateral cases. © 2014

BACKGROUND: Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a common form of congenital 
kidney anomaly. The cause of MCDK is unknown. We investigated whether MCDK in 
children is linked to cytogenomic aberrations.
METHODS: We conducted array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in ten 
unrelated children with MCDK. The pattern of inheritance was determined by 
real-time PCR in patients and their biological parents.
RESULTS: Pathogenic aberrations were detected in three patients: a deletion at 
7p14.3 with a size of 2.07 Mb housing 12 genes, including BBS9 (Bardet-Biedl 
syndrome 9) and BMPER (BMP binding endothelial regulator); a duplication at 
16p13.11p12.3 with a size of 3.28 Mb that included >20 genes; and monosomy X for 
a female patient. The deletion at 7p14.3 was inherited from the patient's 
father, while the duplication at 16p13.11p12.3 was derived from the patient's 
mother.
CONCLUSIONS: Up to 30% of patients with MCDK possess cytogenomic aberrations. 
BBS9 and BMPER variants have been reported to result in cystic kidney dysplasia, 
suggesting a possible pathogenic function for the deletion at 7p14.3 in children 
with MCDK. The duplication at 16p13.11p12.3 was not reported previously to 
associate with MCDK. Both variations were inherited from parents, indicating 
hereditary contributions in MCDK. Thus, aCGH is an informative tool to unravel 
the pathogenic mechanisms of MCDK.
IMPACT: Cytogenomic aberrations are common in children with MCDK. Cytogenomic 
aberrations are inherited from parents, indicating hereditary contributions in 
MCDK. aCGH is a valuable tool to reveal pathogenic mechanisms of MCDK.

Author information:
(1)Women's Hospital Zhejiang Universty Medical College, Hangzhou 310006, China.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnosis, clinical course and prognosis of fetal 
multicystic kidney dysplasia (MCDK).
METHODS: 24 858 pregnant women detected by prenatal ultrasound, here were 41 
cases with fetal multicystic kidney dysplasia, these fetuses were diagnosed at 
average 29.8 weeks of gestation, Carried on an observation to fetuses with 
multicystic kidney dysplasia and postnatal follow-up study.
RESULTS: T17 cases were induced abortion. Of 13 infants, 1 case involute, 3 
cases decrease, 9 cases no change.
CONCLUSION: Prenatal ultrasonography can actual diagnosis for fetal multicystic 
kidney dysplasia, the key of management of multicystic kidney dysplasia is 
assessment of fetal prognosis, the natural history of unilateral MCDK is usually 
benign, the affected kidneys tend to show involution after birth. But bilateral 
MCDK often associated with impairement of renal function, abnormal chromosome or 
other anomalies, which indicates a poor prognosis.

Unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney with progressive infundibular stenosis 
in the contralateral kidney: experience at 1 center and review of literature.

Dally EA(1), Raman A, Webb NR, Farnsworth RH.

Author information:
(1)Sydney Children's Hospital Randwick, Sydney, Australia.

PURPOSE: We analyzed the association between unilateral multicystic dysplastic 
kidney and subsequent contralateral infundibular stenosis, which can result in 
progressive calyceal dilatation, and has been linked to global hyperfiltration 
injury and renal impairment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the last 10 years 200 children presented with 
unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney. Of these children 5 subsequently 
exhibited contralateral infundibular stenosis. We reviewed the published data on 
multicystic dysplastic kidney as well as infundibular stenosis to examine this 
association further.
RESULTS: Three patients underwent open surgical exploration since rapid 
progression with associated parenchymal thinning was detected. Literature review 
failed to identify any discussion of infundibular stenosis in studies focusing 
on long-term followup of children with a unilateral multicystic dysplastic 
kidney. Several case reports and case series discuss this condition in 
association with other collecting system anomalies. However, these anomalies are 
hypothesized to be part of a disease spectrum resulting from aberrant formation 
of the collecting system. Bilateral involvement has been reported in fewer than 
10 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our cases represent a part of the spectrum of pyelocalyceal 
dysgenesis that can have bilateral involvement of varying degrees. Of particular 
concern was the delayed presentation in some of our patients and the progressive 
nature of the lesions. Although exceedingly rare, we wish to highlight the 
association of multicystic dysplastic kidney and progressive infundibular 
stenosis of the contralateral kidney and renal impairment.

Antenatal diagnosis of Multicystic Renal Dysplasia.

Ranke A(1), Schmitt M, Didier F, Droulle P.

(1)Service de Chirurgie Pédiatrique B, Hôpital d'Enfants, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, 
France.

Multicystic Renal Dysplasia (MRD) was discovered during antenatal ultrasound 
examination in 138 fetuses between 1980 and 1995. Associated malformations were 
present in 66 % (42 % urological) and 22 % of the fetuses did not survive the 
pregnancy or the peri-natal period.Anatomical analysis showed a wider variety of 
MRD than in classical descriptions. Obstruction of the urinary tract was almost 
invariable. Like the hypothesis published by Beck in 1971, our view is that, 
with a very early obstruction of the urinary tract (during the first trimester), 
there is a dysplastic evolution of renal tissue, while later in pregnancy the 
same obstruction can induce a hydronephrosis with corticomedullary dysplasia.We 
advise complete neonatal urological investigation, and surgical removal of 
multicystic kidneys, to avoid multiple and inadequate evaluations of those 
children with a single functioning renal unit.

The case of a 16-year-old male patient with left renal artery stenosis due to 
fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and an atrophic kidney due to a right multicystic 
dysplastic kidney (MCDK) who presented with refractory hypertension is reported. 
On continuous Doppler imaging, the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the stenotic 
site of the left renal artery was 404 cm/s. The FMD formed a "string-of-beads" 
appearance on computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and renal artery 
angiography. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) with a balloon 
catheter was performed, after which the left renal artery returned to near 
normal, and his blood pressure decreased to within the normal range. In this 
case, the main cause of refractory hypertension was considered to have been 
renal artery stenosis due to left FMD.

We reviewed the records of 144 patients. The mean gestational age at first US 
diagnosis was 27.5 ± 4.3 weeks. An anomaly of the contralateral kidney was 
detected in 25% of cases. An extrarenal anomaly was detected in 13.8%. Karyotype 
analysis was performed in 16.6% of cases and revealed trisomy 18 in 2 cases with 
extrarenal defects. Karyotype analysis was normal in all the patients who had 
isolated multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK). The diagnostic accuracy of 
prenatal ultrasound was 92.2%. Contralateral kidney anomaly was detected 33.9% 
of patients, and half of these were vesicoureteral reflux. Antihypertensive 
therapy was required in 2.6% of cases. Nephrectomy was performed in 8%, and 
partial or total involution of MCDK was achieved in 33.9% of patients. MCDK can 
be accurately diagnosed by prenatal sonography, and prognosis depends on 
extrarenal and contralateral renal abnormalities. In isolated cases, require of 
surgery is rare, and serial follow-up is suggested to determine 
involution.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Multicystic 
dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is one of the most renal anomalies and is associated 
with numerous renal and extrarenal abnormalities. It can lead to severe 
consequences in the neonatal period.What do the results of this study add? The 
accuracy of prenatal ultrasonography is excellent for detecting MCDK. In 
isolated unilateral cases, chromosomal aberrations are low, and the majority of 
them involute spontaneously. A periodic follow-up of the contralateral kidney is 
mandatory due to an increased risk of an anomaly. Genital anomaly risk is 
increased in males.What are the implications of these findings for clinical 
practice and/or further research? Detailed evaluation and follow-up of the 
contralateral kidney are crucial for counselling in isolated cases. Karyotype 
analysis in isolated unilateral MCDK is debateable. Postnatal prognosis is 
encountering, and the majority of patients have no requirement of surgery.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a relatively common developmental 
anomaly in infants and children and has a good prognosis. In contrast, a 
malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (MRTK) is one of the most lethal 
neoplasms of early life. However, the presentation of such a lethal tumor 
combined with multicystic dysplasia has not been reported to date. In this 
report, we describe a case of MRTK in a 5-yr-old girl who also had multicystic 
dysplasia. She was previously diagnosed with MCDK at birth due to a huge 
palpable mass on the right side of the abdomen. The right kidney was extensively 
replaced by numerous grossly dilated, variable-sized cysts. Microscopically, the 
tumor cells show a diffusely infiltrative growth pattern, which revealed large 
non-cohesive, round-to-polygonal tumor cells with vesicular nuclei. Some tumor 
cells had eccentric nuclei and large, round, eosinophilic cytoplasmic 
inclusions. There were metanephrons present, with the central ureteric bud and 
peripheral branches surrounded by condensing mesenchyma, immature glomeruli, and 
metaplastic cartilage in the adjacent parenchyma. To our knowledge, this is the 
first combined case of the two aforementioned diseases and this case may, in 
fact, suggest a new disease entity.

The clinical spectrum of renal dysplasia includes the non-functioning 
multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK). We report our experience of the outcome of 
unilateral MCDK and its contralateral kidney in 101 children with the diagnosis 
of MCDK from 1985 to 2009. Data collected included urine protein/creatinine 
ratio, estimated GFR (eGFR), blood pressure, surgical intervention, renal length 
and abnormalities of the contralateral kidney, and the involution rate. There 
was a predominance of left-sided MCDK. Diagnosis was made prenatally in 86.7%. 
Contralateral abnormalities included vesicoureteral reflux (16.8%), UPJ 
obstruction (4.1%), and megaureter (2.4%). Complete involution of MCDK occurred 
within 5 years in 60%. Compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney to 
>97% occurred in 74.1%. Nephrectomy was performed in 19.8%. There was an 
increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage ≥ 2, and hypertension in 
those with contralateral abnormalities (p<0.0001; p<0.001 respectively). In 
those without contralateral abnormalities, hyperfiltration with mean eGFR of 149 
± 13 ml/min/1.73 m(2) was seen in 32% and proteinuria in 9.8%. There was a 
significantly inverse relationship between proteinuria and eGFR (p<0.0001). In 
conclusion, children with contralateral abnormalities are at risk for developing 
decreased kidney function, whereas a substantial number of patients with no 
obvious contralateral abnormalities have markers of renal injury. Therefore, 
systematic follow-up of all patients is recommended.

OBJECTIVES: To assess outcomes of unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney 
(MCDK) managed at an Australasian centre over a 15 year period. To assess if 
MCDK involution could be predicted based on change noted between first two 
postnatal ultrasound scans 6 months apart.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed.
RESULTS: One-hundred-and-six cases of unilateral MCDK were studied. Eighty-four 
of these presented antenatally. Twenty-two MCDK cases presented postnatally. 
Urological anomalies associated with MCDK included vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), 
ureterocele and contralateral pelviureteric junction obstruction (PUJO). 
Children undergoing surgical intervention for these anomalies were offered 
concurrent MCDK nephrectomy. Morbidity associated with MCDK under surveillance 
included febrile culture-positive urinary tract infection in 20 cases (20.7%), 
hypertension in four (3.7%) and Wilms' tumor in one (0.9%). Thirty-six cases 
(34%) underwent complete involution, 32 (30.2%) were in the process of 
involuting and 38 cases (35.8%) underwent nephrectomy because of failure of 
involution or associated morbidity. If the MCDK reduced in cranio-caudal 
interpolar length by 20% or more between the first postnatal USS and the next 
one 6 months later, then it was very likely to involute spontaneously. If the 
MCDK did not reduce in cranio-caudal interpolar length by 20% between the first 
postnatal scan and the next one 6 months later, then it was highly likely to 
fail to involute, and in our study, correlated with the outcome of nephrectomy.
CONCLUSION: Although MCDK is a benign condition, it should be carefully 
investigated and followed-up, as involution may not occur in over a third. In 
some cases, morbidity may occur. Each case of MCDK should be managed on its own 
merits.

Multicystic renal dysplasia is a congenital cystic anomaly of the kidney caused 
by abnormal metanephric differentiation with immature tubules. It is surrounded 
by mesenchymal collars and islands of immature mesenchyma present between the 
cysts. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway is a key regulator involved in cell 
growth, proliferation, motility, survival, and apoptosis. Activation of the 
PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway results in the survival and proliferation of tumor cells 
in many cancers. The aim of this study is to analyze the topographic expression 
of phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, and phospho-70S6K in renal development and in the 
multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK). A total of 17 fetal kidneys of development 
age from the first to the third trimester and 13 cases of pathological kidneys 
with MCDK were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in order to evaluate the 
expression of phospho-AKT (S473), phospho-mTOR, and phospho-70S6K. Phospho-AKT 
and phospho-mTOR were expressed early in renal development and in an identical 
manner for every structure derived from the ureteric bud, such as collecting 
ducts and urothelium. Phospho-p70S6K was expressed early in the urothelium and 
in glomerular mesangial cells. Later, their expressions differed according to 
the needs of cell proliferation and differentiation over time by becoming more 
selective. In MCDK, phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, and phospho-70S6K have the same 
profile: a high cytoplasmic expression in cystic epithelium, loose mesenchyma, 
and primitive tubes. This study demonstrates the essential and specific role of 
the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in the formation of cysts in multicystic renal 
dysplasia.

Dysplastic kidneys.

London, UK. pwinyard@ich.ucl.ac.uk

Dysplastic kidneys are common malformations affecting up to 1 in 1000 of the 
general population. They are part of the spectrum of Congenital Abnormalities of 
the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT) and an increasing number of children are 
being diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound. In the past, these patients may not 
have been detected until adulthood following investigation for other illness, or 
even as incidental findings at post mortem, unless there was severe bilateral 
dysplasia leading to Potter's sequence or renal failure in childhood. Excluding 
syndromic cases with defects in other organ systems, features linked to worse 
prognosis at presentation are: (1) bilateral disease; (2) decreased functional 
renal mass (which encompasses not just small kidneys but also large ones where 
cysts replace normal architecture); (3) lower urinary tract obstruction; and (4) 
anhydramnios or severe oligohydramnios. Dysplasia and renal function are dynamic 
and can evolve during pregnancy, so repeated assessment is necessary when 
pathology is expected. Worsening dimensions or decreasing amniotic fluid levels 
imply poorer prognosis, but there are no proven therapies during pregnancy, 
though vesicoamniotic shunting may be indicated with obstruction. Postnatal 
investigations aim to define the anatomy, which helps to estimate risks of 
infection and kidney function. Management might then involve observation, 
prophylactic antibiotics, surgery and/or renal support. Risks of renal 
malignancy and hypertension are low during childhood, but longer-term follow-up 
is needed, particularly to determine blood pressure and renal function in 
adulthood and pregnancy. Around 10% of cases have a family history of 
significant renal/urinary tract malformation. Monogenic causes include mutations 
in individual genes, such as TCF2/hepatocyte nuclear factor 1ss (HNF1beta), PAX2 
and uroplakins, but there are also recent reports of children with compound 
heterozygote mutations in several renal/urinary tract developmental genes. 
Effective genetic screening in future may require gene chip or other techniques 
to assess multiple genes concurrently, but this should not replace a 
multidisciplinary approach to these often difficult cases.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical features of patients with multicystic 
dysplastic kidney (MCDK).
METHODS: The medical files of children diagnosed with MCDK between January 2008 
and November 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The demographic, clinical, 
laboratory and radiological data were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 128 children with MCDK enrolled in the study, 82 (64.1%) were male, 
and 46 (35.9%) were female (P < 0.05). MCDK were located on left and right sides 
in 66 (51.6%) and 62 children (48.4%), respectively (P > 0.05). Antenatal 
diagnosis was present in 64 patients (50%). The mean age at diagnosis was 2.8 ± 
2.7 years (range, 0-8 years), and follow-up duration was 4.5 years. Fifteen 
patients (20.8%) had vesicoureteral reflux. Of these, four underwent endoscopic 
surgical correction. Other associated urological anomalies were ureteropelvic 
junction obstruction (n = 6), hypospadias (n = 1), and kidney stones (n = 1). On 
technetium-99 m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy, which was performed in all 
patients, no significant association between grade of reflux and presence of 
scarring was seen. Hypertension was diagnosed only in one child (0.8%) who 
required antihypertensive treatment. The prevalence of unilateral undescended 
testicle in children aged <1 year in the 82 male patients was 4.9%. Seventy-six 
patients (59.4%) developed compensatory hypertrophy in the contralateral kidney 
during a 1 year follow-up period. Of the total, only seven children (5.5%) had 
undergone nephrectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: MCDK follows a benign course with relatively few sequelae, and 
therefore these patients should be closely followed up and conservatively 
managed.

INTRODUCTION: Traditionally, a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) has been obtained 
in patients diagnosed with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) because of 
published vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) rates between 10%-20%. However, with the 
diagnosis and treatment of low grade VUR undergoing significant changes, we 
questioned the utility of obtaining a VCUG in healthy patients with a MCDK. We 
reviewed our experience to see how many of the patients with documented VUR 
required surgical intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of children diagnosed 
with unilateral MCDK from 2002 to 2012 who also underwent a VCUG.
RESULTS: A total of 133 patients met our inclusion criteria. VUR was identified 
in 23 (17.3%) children. Four patients underwent ureteral reimplant (3.0%). 
Indications for surgical therapy included breakthrough urinary tract infections 
(2 patients), evidence of dysplasia/scarring (1 patient) and non-resolving 
reflux (1 patient). All patients with a history of VUR who are toilet trained, 
regardless of the grade or treatment, are currently being followed off 
antibiotic prophylaxis. To date, none have had a febrile urinary tract infection 
(UTI) since cessation of prophylactic antibiotics. Hydronephrosis in the 
contralateral kidney was not predictive of VUR (p = 0.99).
CONCLUSION: Routine VCUG in healthy children diagnosed with unilateral MCDK may 
not be warranted given the low incidence of clinically significant VUR. If a 
more conservative strategy is preferred, routine VCUG may be withheld in those 
children without normal kidney hydronephrosis and considered in patients with 
normal kidney hydronephrosis. If a VCUG is not performed the family should be 
instructed in signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection.

Pediatric segmental multicystic dysplastic kidney is a rare subtype of 
multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, with only 18 case reports published. All 
children previously reported with this condition presented during infancy. This 
is the first case of segmental multicystic dysplastic kidney in an adolescent 
girl. The case is discussed, along with a review of published reports.

BACKGROUND: Zinner syndrome (ZS), the association of congenital seminal vesicle 
cyst (SVC) and ipsilateral kidney anomalies, is rarely diagnosed in childhood. 
This study aimed to assess presentation, imaging findings, management, and 
outcome of pediatric ZS.
METHODS: Sixteen children with ZS were diagnosed and managed at our hospital 
from 2003 to 2021. We reviewed the medical records to collect data on initial 
symptoms, results of imaging studies, complications, operation, and follow-up.
RESULTS: Ultrasound was used in all 16 cases as initial diagnostic tool. 
Fourteen patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis: these were transferred from 
obstetricians or pediatricians for evaluation of the prenatally or postnatally 
detected ultrasonic kidney anomalies. SVCs were incidentally noted on 
ultrasonography. The other two cases initially presented with urinary tract 
infection (UTI). Kidney anomalies included multicystic dysplastic kidney in 3 
and kidney agenesis in 13 patients. Eleven (68.7%) patients had ipsilateral 
ectopic ureters entering SVC. Four (36.4%) patients had a reflux from urethra 
into SVC (urethro-cystic reflux) on voiding cystourethrography. Ten (62.5%) 
patients remained asymptomatic over a mean of 58 months (range, 7-216 months), 
two patients developed lower urinary tract dysfunction, and five patients had 
UTIs. Two boys needed SVC removal, and SVC had disappeared in two patients after 
2.5-4 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral kidney hypodysplasia with ectopic ureter inserting into 
the ipsilateral SVC is a characteristic sign for diagnosis of ZS. In our case 
series, ZS was mainly asymptomatic. Urethro-cystic reflux was associated with 
UTIs in young infants. SVC removal was rarely required. A higher resolution 
version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.

OBJECTIVES: There is a lack of a standardised protocol for the investigation and 
non-operative management of paediatric multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK). 
Institutional protocols for non-operative management remain essentially ad hoc. 
The primary outcome of this systematic review is to establish the incidence of 
hypertension associated with an MCDK. The secondary outcome is to determine the 
malignancy risk associated with an MCDK. The tertiary outcome is to assess the 
rate of MCDK involution. Subsequent to these, an evidence-based algorithm for 
follow-up is described.
METHODOLOGY: A systematic review of all relevant studies published between 1968 
and April 2017 was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies were identified by specific 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, all of which included data relevant to the 
primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes. Hypertension was defined as systolic 
blood pressure greater than the 95th centile for gender, age and height centile. 
Subset analysis was performed for hypertension associated with an MCDK.
RESULTS: The primary outcome measure revealed a 3.2% (27/838) risk of developing 
hypertension associated with an MCDK. The secondary outcome measure noted a 
0.07% malignancy risk (2/2820). The tertiary outcome measure established that 
53.3% (1502/2820) had evidence of involution of the dysplastic kidney. A total 
of 44 cohort studies (2820 patients) were analysed.
CONCLUSION: Given the low risk of hypertension and malignancy, which is similar 
to the general population, the current conservative non-operative pathway is an 
appropriate management strategy. An algorithm to help support clinicians with

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical course of multicystic dysplastic kidney 
(MCDK) and to reveal any criteria indicating spontaneous involution.
MATERIAL METHODS: Hospital records of patients with MCDK followed in two 
different institutions in 1994-2009 were reviewed and data were analyzed 
regarding involution.
RESULTS: Records of 96 patients were reviewed, of whom 46 were diagnosed 
antenatally and followed for more than 1 year. Fourteen patients had undergone 
nephrectomy. There was one case of hypertension which resided with nephrectomy. 
There was no malignancy. Involution rate was 53.6% (15/28) for right-sided and 
only 16.7% (3/18) for left-sided kidneys. The initial size of the kidney was 
found to be another predictive parameter for involution. Initial sizes of 43 (15 
involuted and 28 non-involuted) kidneys were documented. Mean standard deviation 
score for involuting and non-involuting kidneys was -3.19 and 3.12, 
respectively. The chance of involution for a large kidney on the left was zero; 
however, involution risk for a small right-sided kidney was 67%.
CONCLUSION: Reviewing a 15-year period of our patient records conveyed data 
supporting current literature mainly encouraging non-operative management of 
MCDK. Further studies are required; however, our two objective indicators, the 
initial size and side of dysplastic kidney, may contribute to the management.

BACKGROUND: Pelvic dystopia of rudimentary multicystic dysplastic kidney as a 
rare cause of bedwetting in children.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 14-year-old Kazakh girl who presented 
with difficulty in starting the stream of urine and intermittent interruption of 
the urinary stream while voiding as well as bedwetting, caused by a rare 
congenital disease (pelvic dystopia of rudimentary multicystic dysplastic 
kidney). The diagnostic workup, differential diagnosis, and management, and a 
review of the literature are presented. Persistent since she was 2 years old, 
bedwetting was stressful for both the parents and child. Initially detected 
radiologically and endoscopically, a bladder mass was thought suspicious for 
ureterocele, papilloma, or mixed tumor of the urinary bladder, but surprisingly, 
turned out to be a pelvic dystopia of the rudimentary multicystic dysplastic 
kidney. Transvesical excision of this mass was performed.
CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of this case report is to draw attention to the fact 
that a persistent case of bedwetting which does not respond to conventional 
therapy should be subject to further examinations to exclude surgical causes of 
the disease.

Multicystic renal dysplasia (MCRD) is the most common cause of abnormally 
enlarged kidney, diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound examination. It is an 
abnormality of the embryonic development in which the renal parenchyma is 
substituted by nonfunctioning renal tissue made up of cysts which do not 
communicate with each other. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), pelviureteric junction 
obstruction, vesicoureteric junction obstruction, and ureterocele are the most 
commonly seen abnormalities in contralateral kidney. Here, we report a case of 
prenatal diagnosis of unilateral MCRD with VUR in contralateral kidney. In 
conclusion, we want to emphasize optimal use of ultrasound imaging to detect 
such abnormalities as early as possible to guide the proper management.

PURPOSE: To compare the prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), febrile 
urinary tract infection (fUTI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) among patients 
with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) diagnosed by renal scintigraphy (RS) 
versus follow-up renal ultrasound (RUS) alone.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients seen at a tertiary care 
center from 2010 to 2020 with MCDK diagnosed by RS or follow-up RUS. Differences 
in the prevalence of VUR, fUTI, and CKD by cohort were assessed using logistic 
regression analysis, Pearson X2 , and Fisher's Exact tests. Temporal trends in 
diagnostic methods used (RUS versus RUS + RS) were evaluated using the 
Cochran-Armitage trend test.
RESULTS: One-hundred seventy-two patients were included: 50% (n = 86) underwent 
RUS + RS and 50% (n = 86) underwent RUS alone to diagnose MCDK. Prevalence of 
VUR, fUTI, and CKD did not significantly vary between groups. Among patients who 
had a VCUG, 4.4% had contralateral VUR (1.7% RUS + RS group; 7.4% RUS group; 
p = 0.19) and 14.5% had at least one fUTI (16.3% RUS + RS group; 12.8% RUS 
group; p = 0.52). Females were significantly more likely to have at least one 
fUTI (p = 0.04). Four patients (2.3%) developed CKD, all in the RUS + RS cohort 
(p = 0.12). Diagnosis of MCDK by RUS versus RUS + RS did not significantly vary 
over time (p = 0.17).
CONCLUSION: Patients with unilateral MCDK confirmed by RS versus RUS alone do 
not significantly vary in the prevalence of VUR, fUTI, or CKD. Renal 
scintigraphy studies may not be necessary in unilateral MCDK diagnosis but 
continue to be used.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Children with isolated unilateral multicystic 
dysplastic kidney (MCDK) or congenital solitary kidney (CSK) undergo serial 
renal ultrasonography with variable frequency until they are transitioned to 
adult care. A growing body of literature suggests the value of frequent 
ultrasonography in this population is limited, providing no benefit to overall 
outcomes. Despite emerging evidence, ultrasound remains overused, resulting in 
avoidable health care expenditures and unnecessary use of resources. With our 
initiative, we aimed to improve quality of care by reducing avoidable 
ultrasounds in these children.
METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, interrupted time series of 
children <18 years with ultrasound-confirmed isolated unilateral MCDK or CSK in 
the outpatient nephrology clinic to evaluate the effect of a decision-making 
algorithm on the proportion of children receiving an avoidable ultrasound. An 
algorithm depicting a consensus, evidence-based protocol for managing pediatric 
MCDK or CSK was refined through content expert feedback and usability testing to 
standardize frequency of ultrasonography. Ultrasounds were deemed necessary 
after birth, at 6 months, and at 2, 5, 10, and 15 years. Differences pre- and 
postintervention were determined by using a U chart and t and F tests for 
significance.
RESULTS: The algorithm resulted in a 47% reduction (P < .001) in the proportion 
of avoidable ultrasounds ordered in children with MCDK and CSK. This reduction 
was sustainable over a 6-month period and would result in at least $46 000 
annual savings.
CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of a clinical decision-making algorithm was associated 
with a reduction in avoidable ultrasound testing. Improving adherence across 
providers may allow for an even more pronounced reduction.

In children, unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is one of the most 
frequently identified urinary tract abnormalities. A variety of proposed 
etiologies has been associated with the underlying pathogenesis of MCDK. These 
include genetic disturbances, teratogens, in utero infections, and urinary 
outflow tract obstruction. From 5-43% of the time, MCDK has associated 
genito-urinary anomalies, both structural and functional in nature. A review of 
the literature reveals that involution rates are reported to be 19-73%, 
compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney occurs from 24-81% of the 
time, and estimated glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) (by the Schwartz formula) 
range from 86-122 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) body surface area. Most authors suggest 
serial ultrasonography to monitor contralateral growth, routine blood pressure 
monitoring, and a serum creatinine monitoring algorithm. The risk of 
hypertension in those with MCDKs does not appear to be greater than that of the 
general population, and the rates of malignant transformation of MCDK are small, 
if at all increased, in comparison with those in the general population. If the 
patient develops a urinary tract infection or has abnormalities of the 
contralateral kidney, shown on ultrasound, a voiding cystourethrogram is 
recommended. Finally, the body of literature does not support the routine 
surgical removal of MCDKs.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with ectopic unilateral multicystic 
dysplastic kidney.

Military Medical University, 415 Fengyang Rd, 200003, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most 
common hereditary renal disorder. In most cases, ADPKD similarly affects 
bilateral kidneys.
CASE PRESENTATION: Among the 605 ADPKD patients that were followed up by our 
center, we identified two male patients with unilateral ADPKD. The cases were 
remarkable because the patients also had ectopia and multicystic dysplasia in 
the contralateral kidney, which are generally sporadic disease conditions. Both 
patients tested positive for polycystic kidney disease 1 mutation, but negative 
for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta mutation. Moreover, the deterioration of 
their kidney function seemed to be quicker than their age- and sex-matched 
controls and siblings. Both patients had started a long-term hemodialysis in 
their 40s.
CONCLUSION: Anatomical and genetic abnormality in patients with ADPKD may be 
more frequent and complex than previously believed. The compensatory capacity in 
patients with ADPKD is fragile, and missing one kidney could accelerate the 
deterioration of renal function.

A 3-year-old male child had left-sided abdominal lump for 4 months. Radiological 
examination revealed a cystic mass in the left kidney. A tentative diagnosis of 
multicystic nephroma was made on clinical and radiological examination. Cytology 
was inconclusive. Nephrectomy was done. A final diagnosis of multicystic 
dysplasia was made on histological examination.

OBJECTIVES: Unilateral multicystic kidney dysplasia (MCKD) is the second most 
common urinary tract abnormality diagnosed antenatally. Whilst an isolated 
unilateral MCKD has a good prognosis, a poor outcome must be expected when MCKD 
is associated with other complex abnormalities.
MATERIAL: Out of 11,176 cases, 693 fetuses were suspected of having urinary 
tract abnormalities. Urological findings were confirmed in 548 of them. 
Unilateral cystic kidney was diagnosed prenatally in 85 cases.
RESULTS: The study results in a total of 107 cases with proven MCKD. Eighty-five 
pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of MCKD were analysed. The antenatal 
diagnosis of MCKD was confirmed in 56 cases. Fifty-one children were found to 
have unilateral MCKD where this had not been explicitly suspected from antenatal 
scanning.
CONCLUSION: Unilateral MCKD is a malformation with an excellent prognosis for 
child survival and global renal function if encountered in isolation. However, 
our analysis of live infants and autopsy cases demonstrates a high proportion of 
severe associated malformations of the urinary tract and other organ systems.

Over recent years routine ultrasound scanning has identified increasing numbers 
of neonates as having hydronephrosis and pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction 
(PUJO). This patient group presents a diagnostic and management challenge for 
paediatric nephrologists and urologists. In this review we consider the known 
molecular mechanisms underpinning PUJO and review the potential of utilising 
this information to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostic biomarkers to 
improve the care of children with this disorder.

BACKGROUND: Children with multicystic kidney disease (MCKD) are increasingly 
managed conservatively, and are followed up throughout childhood because of the 
risk of hypertension highlighted in some reports. With this risk still poorly 
defined, the strategy and the duration of follow up do not seem to be based on 
evidence.
METHODS: Systematic review of the literature for all published cohort studies 
(prospective and retrospective) of children diagnosed to have unilateral MCKD 
and managed conservatively. Exclusion criteria were bilateral MCKD, and 
nephrectomy (not for hypertension) during the follow up period. For children 
with MCKD, the probability of developing hypertension during the follow up 
period was estimated.
RESULTS: From 29 reviewed studies, six cases of hypertension developed in 1115 
eligible children. The mean probability of a child with unilateral MCKD 
developing hypertension was therefore 5.4 per 1000 (95% CI estimated at 1.9 to 
11.7 per 1000).
CONCLUSION: Although the risk of hypertension in MCKD is low, the results of 
this study do not allow firm recommendations on the frequency and duration of 
blood pressure measurement follow up for these children. Large prospective 
cohort studies with a very long duration of follow up are needed.

PURPOSE: The contralateral kidney is abnormal in up to 25% of patients with 
multicystic dysplastic kidney. Traditionally, anatomical and functional 
evaluation of the contralateral kidney has been performed with ultrasound and 
dimercapto-succinic acid renal scintigraphy, as indicated. Recently magnetic 
resonance urography has been used to evaluate renal anatomy and function in 
other urological abnormalities. We compared the results of magnetic resonance 
urography and ultrasound for evaluating the contralateral kidney in patients 
with multicystic dysplastic kidney and we describe the range of findings 
detected.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with multicystic dysplastic kidney who underwent 
magnetic resonance urography were identified. Anatomical findings on magnetic 
resonance urography were analyzed and compared to those on renal ultrasound. 
Additional functional information derived from magnetic resonance urography was 
also recorded.
RESULTS: We retrospectively identified 58 patients with a unilateral multicystic 
dysplastic kidney who had undergone magnetic resonance urography, of whom 54 
also underwent ultrasound. Of the patients 19 (32.8%) had a contralateral 
abnormality. A discrepancy between magnetic resonance urography and ultrasound 
was seen in 9 patients (16.7%). Of these patients only 1 had a completely normal 
contralateral kidney by ultrasound on retrospective review. The incidence and 
range of parenchymal abnormalities was wider than previously reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral abnormalities in children with multicystic dysplastic 
kidney are common and more definitively evaluated with magnetic resonance 
urography vs ultrasound. Renal ultrasound remains the most appropriate modality 
for the initial evaluation of children with multicystic dysplastic kidney, and 
magnetic resonance urography is recommended when a functional study is required 
either to confirm the diagnosis of multicystic dysplastic kidney or to evaluate 
suspected abnormalities of the contralateral kidney.

OBJECTIVE: To report the renal structural and functional anomalies in children 
with multicystic dysplastic kidneys.
METHODS: Retrospective descriptive analysis of 47 children with multicystic 
dysplastic kidney seen in a pediatric nephrology unit over a period of 6 years.
RESULTS: Antenatal diagnosis of multicystic dysplastic kidney was made in 34 
(72.3%) patients. On follow up of 31 children for more than 12 months, 21 (68%) 
had involution, 4 [13%] had non-regression, and 4 (13%) were nephrectomized. 
Vesico-ureteric reflux (n=13; 28%) was the commonest renal abnormality. The 
serum creatinine values were higher (P=0.006) in children with contralateral 
reflux. Sub-nephrotic proteinuria was noted in 9 (29%) and was significantly 
associated with complete involution (P=<0.023). None of the patients developed 
hypertension and 2 (6.4%) had renal failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Close nephrological follow-up is needed in children with 
multicystic dysplasia of kidneys.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney is a rare congenital anomaly of the kidney and 
urinary tract. The association with the posterior urethral valve is also very 
rare. Here we present a patient with both entities and prenatal resolution of 
the cysts.A 10-week old baby was referred for nephrourological work up due to 
prenatal diagnosis of the left multicystic kidney. He had serial US scans during 
the pregnancy. Immediately before delivery the cysts were not seen (prenatal 
resolution). There were no extrarenal anomalies. The first postnatal ultrasound 
scan revealed normal sized right kidney without dilatation of the pelvicalyceal 
system. The bladder had normal thickness of the wall. Technetium-99m 
dimercaptosuccinic acid scan showed no activity on the left side, and the right 
kidney appeared normal. At two months of age, a poor urinary steam was observed 
and additional urologic work up was indicated on clinical suspicion of PUV. 
Voiding urethrocystography revealed posterior urethral valve and the baby 
underwent cytoscopic valve resection.Conclusion: We present a rare association 
of two congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract with prenatal 
involution of the multicystic dysplastic kidney that is extremely rare event as 
seen in our case. Presence of posterior urethral valve must be suspected in a 
male baby with a poor urinary stream even when his ultrasound scan of urinary 
system appears normal.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) in 
children with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) who have a normal versus 
abnormal contralateral kidney and bladder ultrasound (US), and assess the risk 
of having vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or urinary tract infection (UTI) based on 
the US results.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review including children with unilateral MCDK 
with postnatal US and VCUG available at our institution between January 2008 and 
September 2017 was performed. Analysis was done to find association between 
abnormal contralateral US and contralateral VUR and UTI.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six children were analyzed; 118(75.6%) patients 
had a normal contralateral kidney US, while 38(24.4%) had abnormal US. The rate 
of severe contralateral VUR (grade IV and V) was 2 (1.7%) and 5 (13.2%) in 
children with normal and abnormal contralateral US, respectively. The risk 
analysis demonstrated a significant association between severe VUR on the 
contralateral kidney and an abnormal contralateral US (odds ratio = 7.73; 95%CI: 
1.43-41.81; P = 0.018) and no significant association with UTI (odds 
ratio = 1.58; 95%CI: 0.50-4.94; P = 0.435).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggests, the rate of severe contralateral VUR in children 
with unilateral MCDK and normal contralateral kidney is low. VCUG should be 
considered for infants with proven MCKD and alterations on the contralateral 
kidney on US. Following patients with MCDK and normal contralateral kidney 
without the use of VCUG is a reasonable approach, unless there is development of 
signs and symptoms of recurrent UTI or deterioration of the renal function. We 
found that abnormal contralateral kidney US was associated with severe VUR.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the need for implementing renal scintigraphy in the 
diagnosis of the multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) and the safety of its 
conservative treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of patients with unilateral MCDK was 
conducted at our centre from January 2005 to August 2015. We calculated the 
positive predictive value (PPV) of ultrasonography, taking renal scintigraphy 
and pathology as the gold standard. We calculated a survival curve according to 
the Kaplan-Meier method to assess the annual probability of spontaneous 
resolution of the multicystic kidney.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were identified, 48 (85.7%) of whom had a prenatal 
diagnosis. Thirty eight (67.9%) of the patients were males, and the left side 
was affected in 33 (58.9%) of the patients. We observed associated urological 
abnormalities in 22 (39.29%) patients, with vesicoureteral reflux the most 
common (8, 14.29%). Seven patients (12.5%) developed renal failure. Forty-nine 
(87.5%) patients developed compensatory contralateral renal hypertrophy. Of the 
33 patients who underwent surgery, the pathology results confirmed the MCDK 
diagnosis in 32. Compared with scintigraphy and pathology, the PPV of 
ultrasonography was 100% and 97%, respectively. The rate of spontaneous 
involution was 5.4% at 3 months of life, 11.3% at 2 years and 38.4% at 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the conservative treatment of MCDK, until at 
least 5 years of age, is safe. Our data suggest that performing scintigraphy is 
not required for these patients, which means lower radiation exposure, as well 
as financial savings.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is one of the most common renal 
abnormalities in children. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical 
course and outcome of patients with MCDK. Ninety pediatric patients with 
unilateral MCDK followed by the Pediatric Nephrology Department of Bakirkoy 
Maternity and Children's Hospital between 1990 and 2007 were included in this 
retrospective study. The dimercaptosuccinic acid radionuclide scan revealed no 
function in MCDK in all of our patients. Voiding cystourethrogram was performed 
in all patients. Twenty patients (22.2%) had abnormalities in the contralateral 
kidney. Nephrectomy was performed in 41 patients (45.5%). Twelve patients had 
undergone routine nephrectomy before 1996. Since then, patients have been 
followed up conservatively, and nephrectomy has been performed only when 
indicated. Indication of nephrectomy was arterial hypertension in 16 patients 
(23.1%), recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in 11 (15.9%), and severe 
abdominal pain in two (2.8%). Hypertension was noted within the first year of 
life in all patients except two. MCDK completely involuted in 39.3% within 48 
months. There was no malignant transformation, proteinuria, or renal failure. In 
conclusion, hypertension is often noticed in infants with MCDK. Uninephrectomy 
leads to normalization. However, prospective studies are needed to exclude a 
spontaneous improvement of hypertension.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of imaging modalities on the evaluation and 
prognosis of children with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all children with MCDK 
diagnosed from 2004 until 2012 was performed. The study included 63 patients for 
whom all postnatal imaging modalities were available: renal bladder ultrasound 
(RBUS), dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). 
Cases with major congenital abnormalities or incomplete data were excluded. 
Abnormalities in the contralateral kidney and the fate of MCDK were also 
addressed.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, the average age was four-and-a-half months. The majority 
of cases were detected antenatally (87%). Postnatal RBUS and DMSA scans 
established the diagnosis of MCDK in 92% and 98% of patients, respectively. DMSA 
showed photopenic areas in the contralateral kidneys in 10% of patients; all of 
them had hydronephrosis and were confirmed to have vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). 
Contralateral VUR was detected in 16 patients; 63% of them had hydronephrosis. 
After a mean follow-up of three-and-a-half years, involution occurred in 62% of 
patients and the involution rate was inversely proportional to the initial size.
CONCLUSIONS: The classical appearance of MCDK on RBUS was sufficient to 
establish the diagnosis in most patients. DMSA scan was more accurate in 
confirming the diagnosis and evaluating the contralateral kidney. Selective 
screening for VUR in patients with contralateral hydronephrotic kidney should be 
considered.

Most multicystic dysplastic kidneys (MCDKs) are discovered prenatally. There is 
no consensus regarding initial workup and appropriate follow-up. We present a 
9-year-old female who was fetally diagnosed with a MCDK and without follow-up 
returned with an 18-cm multicystic mass. The patient underwent laparoscopic 
nephrectomy. Final pathology revealed a dermoid cyst arising in a pediatric 
kidney, which to our knowledge has not been previously described. Patients with 
MCDK have hypertension as a possible sequela and possible reflux to their 
functioning kidney. Voiding cystourethrogram seems reasonable initially, and 
renal ultrasound is ideally noninvasive. Focused clinical awareness of the 
solitary kidney is important.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of obstructed hydronephrotic kidney mimicking a 
multicystic kidney and to review the literature regarding differentiation of the 
hydronephrotic variant of multicystic kidney from the obstructed hydronephronic 
kidney. To suggest a possible algorithm in distinguishing them.
METHODS: We have reported a case of a 35-year-old male who presented with dull 
aching pain and a palpable right-sided cystic flank mass of several years 
duration. The initial workup suggested a nonfunctioning multicystic kidney while 
the operative findings and histopathology were suggestive of an obstructed 
hydroenphrotic kidney with pyelonephritic changes. We searched the literature 
using the key words hydronephrotic dysplastic kidney and multicystic kidney.
RESULTS: A detailed literature search did not reveal any such publication 
describing the differentiation of the hydronephrotic multicystic dysplastic 
kidney from the obstructed hydronephrotic kidney of pelviureteral obstruction. 
We reviewed the existing literature on this subject, on the basis of which, we 
have suggested a six-stepladder approach to distinguish such cases.
CONCLUSION: By using the 6 step ladder protocol algorithm suggested by us one 
can attempt to distinguish the hydronephrotic variant of multicystic dysplastic 
kidney from the hydronephrotic kidney due to pelviureteral obstruction in 
patients presenting with a symptomatic cystic flank masses of renal origin. 
Differentiation between the two may be difficult at times due to the 
medial/central placement of cysts in the former. This is necessary since renal 
salvage may be possible in the latter while timely nephrectomy may be considered 
in the former to prevent against the hazards of leaving behind a dysplastic 
kidney in situ.

BACKGROUND: Creating obstructive uropathy (OU) during glomerulogenesis in the 
fetal lamb results in multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) at term. We explored 
this using immunohistochemical techniques.
METHOD: OU was created in fetal lambs at 60-day gestation, ligating the urethra 
and urachus. The kidneys of MCDK lambs, 60-day gestation fetal lambs, full-term 
lamb (145 days), term sham-operated lambs, and adult ewes were evaluated by HE 
staining, and immunohistochemistry with paired box genes 2 (PAX2) and CD10.
RESULTS: Multiple cysts were found in the MCDK model. CD10 was expressed in 
proximal tubular epithelial cells, glomerular epithelial cells, and medullary 
stromal cells in the kidneys of 60-day gestation fetal lambs and full-term lambs 
and adult ewes. PAX2 expression was found in ureteric buds, C- and S-shaped 
bodies, epithelial cells of collecting ducts, and Bowman's capsule of fetal 
kidneys at 60-day gestation, but only in the collecting ducts of full-term fetal 
lambs and adult ewes. Both CD10 and PAX2 were expressed in the cystic epithelial 
cells of the MCDK model.
DISCUSSION: PAX2 expression in cystic epithelial cells suggests that cyst 
formation is associated with disturbed down-regulation of PAX2 in the 
nephrogenic zone epithelial cells during the renal development in the OU model.

Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney and Incontinentia Pigmenti: Coexistence of 2 Rare 
Diseases.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney is a congenital kidney malformation consisting of 
multiple cysts of various sizes without a normal kidney morphology. 
Incontinentia pigmenti is a rare X-linked dominant genodermatosis, which is 
usually lethal in males, that presents clinically in 4 stages. Here, we report a 
case of multicystic dysplastic kidney with ureterovesical junction obstruction 
and incontinentia pigmenti. Coexistence of these two rare diseases may be a 
coincidental phenomenon or an association between the two may exist.

OBJECTIVE: It is critical to differentiate between a multicystic dysplastic 
kidney (MCDK) and a kidney with severe hydronephrosis as the treatment varies 
significantly. We designed a study to compare renal ultrasound (RUS) to nuclear 
medicine (NM) scan in the diagnosis of MCDK, in order to determine if RUS can be 
used for the definitive diagnosis of MCKD without use of NM scan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of children with 
MCDK, who underwent both a RUS and Tc-99m MAG3 or DMSA scan. We planned to 
calculate the positive predictive value of an RUS diagnosis of MCDK, using NM 
scan diagnosis of a nonfunctioning kidney as the gold standard.
RESULTS: The diagnosis of MCDK was made by RUS in 91 patients, 84 of whom had a 
normal bladder US. NM confirmed the diagnosis of MCDK in all 84 of these 
patients (100%).
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a high predictive value for RUS in the 
diagnosis of MCDK. Our data support that in healthy infants with RUS diagnosis 
of unilateral MCDK and normal bladder US, NM scan may be unnecessary to confirm 
the diagnosis.

Dijkzigt, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: To review the prenatal assessment of associated renal pathology, 
non-renal pathology and renal biometry, fetal outcome and postnatal urological 
management in the presence of unilateral fetal multicystic dysplastic kidney.
METHODS: A total of 38 singleton pregnancies with fetal unilateral multicystic 
dysplastic kidney was studied over a 13-year period. Prenatally, fetal biometry, 
including head and abdominal circumferences and largest longitudinal diameter of 
the affected and contralateral kidneys, was performed. The amount of amniotic 
fluid was assessed. Fetal karyotyping was offered in cases of contralateral 
renal or non-renal pathology. A MAG 3 scan and voiding cystogram was performed 
approximately 4 weeks after delivery to establish renal function and to exclude 
urinary reflux.
RESULTS: Unilateral fetal multicystic dysplastic kidney was left-sided in 53% 
and right-sided in 47% of cases. The fetus was male in 63% and female in 37% of 
cases. Associated renal and non-renal pathology existed in 21% and 5% of cases, 
respectively. The fetal karyotype in these subsets was always normal. The 
longitudinal diameter of the multicystic dysplastic kidney was above the 95th 
centile in 87%. There was polyhydramnios in three cases and oligohydramnios in 
two cases. The prematurity rate was 16%. Postnatal examination revealed a 
non-functional multicystic kidney in 87% (33/38) of cases. Following surgical 
removal of the affected kidney, these infants progressed normally. Of the 
remaining five infants, four died because of associated anomalies and one infant 
developed normally without surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Fetal outcome is determined by associated renal and/or non-renal 
structural pathology and not by the size/location of the unilateral multicystic

We sought to evaluate the diagnostic value of foetal magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) for multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) disease. We retrospectively 
identified 55 foetuses with MCDK diagnosed (51 unilateral; 4 bilateral) by 
foetal MRI. We analysed the anatomical findings by prenatal MRI and compared 
them with the prenatal ultrasound (US) and postnatal findings. Additional 
diagnostic information added by MRI was recorded. The gestational age of the 55 
foetuses ranged from 22 to 35 weeks (mean, 26.5 ± 3.6 weeks). The age of the 
pregnant women ranged from 23 to 40 years (mean, 31 ± 4.2 years). All 55 cases 
were performed at 1.5 T magnetic resonance unit. MRI sequences, including 
steady-state free precession (SSFP), single-shot fast spin echo (SSFSE), 
T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences. 
Follow-up was obtained for 53 cases (2 cases of autopsy, 51 cases of postnatal 
imaging or surgery confirmed). Among the 51 unilateral cases, 16 cases were 
associated with other urinary tract anomalies, 3 cases with extra-renal 
anomalies, and the remaining 32 cases without associated anomalies. 2 of 16 
cases with contralateral renal agenesis were with oligohydramnios and pulmonary 
hypoplasia. 2 of 4 bilateral MCDK presented with oligohydramnios and pulmonary 
hypoplasia. 52 of 53 cases were correctly diagnosed by MRI compared with the 
final diagnoses; 40 of 53 (75.5%) cases were correctly diagnosed by prenatal 
ultrasound. Both prenatal ultrasound and MRI failed to correctly diagnose one 
case bilateral MCDK, and MRI correctly changed the ultrasound diagnosis in 12 
cases. Foetal MRI can add additional diagnostic information to prenatal US in 
the assessment of MCDK, even change the prenatal counselling and decisions.

Children's Hospital, Şanlıurfa, Turkey. d.caglaserpil@yahoo.com.

This study was performed to evaluate the clinical course and renal outcome of 
patients with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK). We 
retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 59 cases with MCDK followed at 
Şanlıurfa Children's Hospital between January 2009 and February 2013. The median 
age of the patients (boys 52.5%) was 31 months (range: 6-197) and the median 
follow-up period was 23 months (range: 6-111). Forty-two (71.2%) patients were 
diagnosed antenatally. The MCDKs were found more often on the right side 
(55.9%). The most frequently associated urological abnormality was contralateral 
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (26.6%). A total of 3 (5%) patients developed 
chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), 2 of whom had grade IV and V VUR; the other 
patient with CRI had a small and hyperechogenic contralateral kidney, suggesting 
dysplasia-hypoplasia, without any urological anomalies on imaging studies. The 
size of MCDK was unchanged in 20 (34%), had regressed in 26 (44%), and had 
increased in 9 (15.3%) patients. Total involution was documented in 4 (6.7%) 
patients. Compensatory hypertrophy occurred in 36/45 (80%) patients, with a mean 
age of 19.2±8.3 months. Proteinuria and hypertension were detected in 1 (1.7 %) 
patient each. In conclusion, abnormalities in the contralateral kidney in 
patients with MCDK increase the risk of renal failure. An initial investigation 
for associated urinary tract malformations should be done and the growth and 
function of the contralateral kidney, hypertension, and proteinuria should be 
monitored in all children with MCDK.

PURPOSE: We evaluated predictive factors for compensatory hypertrophy and renal 
outcomes in a large cohort of patients with multicystic dysplastic kidneys.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review from 1997 to 2016. 
Contralateral kidney and multicystic dysplastic kidney length were recorded from 
all ultrasounds as well as creatinine when available. We used generalized 
estimating equations to determine predictors of contralateral kidney length.
RESULTS: A total of 443 children with multicystic dysplastic kidneys were 
identified based on sonographic findings and lack of function on nuclear scan. 
Average followup was 3.2 years (IQR 1.5 to 5.7). Median time to involution in 
patients diagnosed before age 2 years was 5.5 years (95% CI 3.8-7.0). In all 
patients the median time to contralateral hypertrophy was 2.7 years (95% CI 
2.2-3.3), and 90% of patients manifested contralateral hypertrophy by 10 years. 
After adjusting for age, gender, multicystic dysplastic kidney side and cohort 
status for each year of involution after age 2 years, the contralateral kidney 
grows 0.35 cm longer (95% CI 0.01-0.68, p = 0.04) compared to cases without 
involution. Patients with contralateral hypertrophy had greater creatinine 
clearance at followup (83 vs 61 ml per minute, p = 0.07), although this finding 
was not statistically significant due to limited data.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with multicystic dysplastic kidneys will 
have contralateral hypertrophy by age 3 years. Multicystic dysplastic kidney 
involution predicts contralateral kidney growth rate after age 2 years. A small 
cohort of patients with multicystic dysplastic kidneys will not exhibit 
contralateral hypertrophy and may be at risk for renal insufficiency.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical characteristics and natural course of 
segmental multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 40 patients (43 
renal units) diagnosed as having segmental MCDK between January 2002 and June 
2014. Segmental MCDK was classified as typical when it was localized to the 
upper pole of a duplex collecting system, and otherwise as atypical. We 
investigated involution, associated anomalies requiring surgery, and 
complications of segmental MCDK.
RESULTS: Of 43 renal units, 23 were typical and 20 were atypical. During 71.5 
(interquartile range: 37.5-84.1) months of median follow-up period, complete and 
partial involution were observed in 48% and 26% of the typical group and 30% and 
35% of the atypical group, respectively. In the typical group, involution was 
complete significantly earlier (P = .048) and ipsilateral anomalies were more 
frequently observed (P = .002). The initiation point of involution and 
contralateral anomalies were not different in the two groups. Hypertension 
developed in 1 case with contralateral MCDK and 1 case with contralateral renal 
agenesis.
CONCLUSION: Segmental MCDK is not a rare disease entity, and conservative 
treatment appears to be sufficient with thorough follow-up, including regular 
monitoring of blood pressure and renal function, and with ultrasonography.

Pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (PUJO) is defined as a functionally 
significant impairment of the flow of urine from the kidney's renal pelvis into 
the proximal ureter. Symptomatically, the patient may experience flank pain, 
recurrent infections, stone formation, and impairment of renal function. 
Although many cases of intrinsic PUJO are diagnosed at birth, a minority of 
patients may present in adulthood with previously silent disease or develop 
secondary PUJO to other causes. PUJO is therefore broadly categorised into both 
primary and secondary PUJO. A wide array of diagnostic scans and tests are 
available to aid in diagnosing and monitoring patients with PUJO. In patients 
with compromised renal function or symptomatic PUJO that require intervention, 
minimally invasive techniques are the 'gold standard' for surgical intervention. 
This review will detail the endoscopic, laparoscopic, and robotic options 
available to the urologist practicing in 2021, including the use of autografts 
and other emerging technologies.

Many diseases can be associated with kidney cysts and they may be classified as 
hereditary and non-hereditary renal cystic disease. The first group can be 
sub-classified as autosomal recessive cystic disease, such as autosomal 
recessive polycystic kidney disease and nephronophthisis, as autosomal dominant 
kidney disease such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, 
glomerulocystic disease and tuberous sclerosis, and as cysts associated with 
syndromes. Cystic dysplasia, multicystic dysplastic kidney, simple cyst, 
multilocular cysts, Wilm's tumor and acquired cystic kidney disease are 
classified in the second group. The genetic study of renal cysts is becoming 
increasingly important, due to the possible therapeutic interventions that could 
be devised in the future. The aim of this review is to provide a fast and easy 
clinical approach to renal cysts.

BACKGROUND: We report the long-term follow-up of children with antenatally 
detected unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) who were followed 
between 1985 and 2009.
METHODS: Involution rates were documented over time based on the initial size of 
the MCDK, as documented on postnatal ultrasound (USS), as well as long-term 
complications and renal function.
RESULTS: In 323 patients (182 male), 10 % of MCDK had involuted, as evidenced on 
the first postnatal USS, with survival function analysis showing the probability 
of complete involution to be 35 % in 249 patients by 2 years of age, 47 % in 180 
patients by 5 years of age and 62 % in 94 patients by 10 years of age. There was 
a significant difference in the involution rates of MCKD at the 10-year 
follow-up between MCDK with an initial size of >5 cm versus MCDK with an initial 
size of ≤5 cm (p < 0.0001). No patients in the whole cohort developed sustained 
hypertension or malignancy during a median follow-up of 10.1 years (range 
0.3-15.4 years). Median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 76 
patients (7 at 5 years, 69 at 10 years) was 93 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (range 46-175 
ml/min/1.73 m(2)), with 40 (53%) having an eGFR of between 90 and 140 
ml/min/1.73 m(2). Twenty-three (30 %) of the 76 patients at 10 years had normal 
eGFR (90-140 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) as well as complete involution of the MCDK, 
compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney, no proteinuria and no 
hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Larger MCDK at birth are less likely to involute during the first 
decade of life. However, conservative management remains justified due to the 
lack of complications. A minority of patients fulfil current criteria for 
discharge from specialty follow-up at 10 years.

Hospital, University of Genova, Largo G. Gaslini, 16100, Genoa, Italy.

OBJECTIVES: Little is reported in literature regarding correct management of 
benign lesions of the kidney. The aim of our study is to present a series of 
total and partial nephrectomies performed in the last 5 years and to discuss 
indications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with benign lesions who underwent nephrectomy 
and partial nephrectomy at our institution in the period 2003-2008 were 
retrospectively included in the study. Notes were carefully reviewed and 
demographic data, symptoms onset, preoperative diagnosis, investigations, 
medical and/or surgical treatment, postoperative complications and definitive 
histological reports were collected.
RESULTS: Forty procedures were performed. Twelve patients were preoperatively 
diagnosed of having multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), which was confirmed in 
10, whereas the remaining 28 patients of having severe dysplasia or 
hypodysplasia. Thirty-four patients underwent total nephrectomy, six underwent 
partial nephrectomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed segmental or complete 
abnormalities of the involved kidney in all cases. No malignancies were 
detected.
DISCUSSION: Our study confirmed the extremely low malignancy rate of MCDK and 
hypodysplastic kidneys. The 20% mismatch of pre- and post-operative diagnosis 
suggests a common aetiology and shared therapeutic strategies for MCDK and 
hypodysplasia. At present, there is no consensus regarding correct indications 
for nephrectomy in paediatric age. As nephrectomy seems not to provide any 
advantage over preservation, but surgical and anesthesiological risks, we should 
be prudent in preserving every asymptomatic poorly or non-functioning kidneys 
maintaining a strict follow-up. Randomised controlled studies on larger 
multicentric series are strongly warranted to define this topic.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The objective of this study is to determine the clinical 
features of unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic 
features of MCDK patients at Diyarbakır Children’s Hospital and Diyarbakır Gazi 
Yaşargil Training and Research Hospital between January 2008-June 2019 were 
retrospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 111 [59 (53.2%) male and 52(46.8%) female] patients with 
MCDK were followed for a mean period of 41.89 ± 32.03 months. MCDK was located 
on the left and right sides in 46 (41.4%) and 65 (58.6%) of the children, 
respectively (p > 0.05). A total of 87 (78.4%) patients had antenatal diagnosis. 
The mean age at diagnosis was 13.7 ± 34.2 months. Of the 49 voiding 
cystourethrogram (VCUG)-performed patients, vesicoureteral reflux was detected 
in 11 patients (22.4%). Other associated urological anomalies in the patients 
were detected in 12 (10.8%) patients. On Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 
scintigraphy which was performed in all patients showed scarring in four 
children. Eight patients had history of UTI (7.2%). Renal failure, hypertension, 
and proteinuria were diagnosed in three children (2.7%). Sixty-nine (62%) 
patients developed compensatory hypertrophy.
CONCLUSION: All cases should be followed up closely and VCUG should be reserved 
for patients with recurrent UTI and other urological problems indicated by 
ultrasonography and abnormal DMSA scan results.

amypiepsz@yahoo.com

The strategy of management of children with hydronephrosis has considerably 
changed as a result of the development of ultrasound techniques, allowing a 
prenatal detection. Hydronephrosis is defined as a dilation of the renal 
collecting system, and several entirely different clinical entities can be 
considered this general heading, whereas early detection may have a different 
impact depending on the entity considered. The present work aims to describe a 
certain number of these clinical entities, to discuss the strategic options of 
management that are proposed, and to evaluate the role of medical imaging, in 
particular the radionuclide approach. Congenital ureteropelvic junction anomaly, 
vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valves, and duplex kidney will be 
successively considered. Multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, although not 
classified as hydronephrosis, will be mentioned because it may be mistaken for 
hydronephrosis.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical features, long-term outcomes, and 
additional urological anomalies of patients treated for multicystic dysplastic 
kidney (MDK).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with MDK who were followed between January 2004 
and October 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, 
laboratory, and radiological data were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 68 patients with MDK were followed for a mean period of 46.8 
± 32.4 months. MDK was detected by antenatal ultrasound in 64 (94.1%) of the 
patients. Ten patients had (14.7%) additional urological anomalies in 
contralateral kidney. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in five patients (7.3%). 
Other urological anomalies were megaureter (two), cortical renal cyst (two), 
ureteropelvic junction obstruction (one), and renal ectopy (one). Urinary tract 
infection was detected in 14 (20.5%) patients. Four (5.9%) patients had 
hypertension. Compensatory hypertrophy was detected in 29 (42.6%) patients. 
Eight (11.8%) of these 29 patients had glomerular hyperfiltration and three 
(4.4%) of these eight patients also had proteinuria. Follow-up ultrasound 
revealed complete involution in 19 (35.8%) patients. Nephrectomy was performed 
in 15 (22.0%) patients. Indications of nephrectomy were, recurrent urinary 
infection (four), hypertension (three), ureterocele (two), renal calculi (one), 
flank pain (one), hematuria (one), persistent large cystic kidney (three), and 
atypical US findings (two).
CONCLUSION: In patients with MDK, depending on the clinical, laboratory, and 
radiological findings, appropriate timing of operation by multidisciplinary 
approach is important for early detection and treatment of any possible 
complications.

Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney is a developmental disease that results in a 
lobulated kidney of noncommunicating cysts and abnormal parenchymal tissue. 
Dysplastic kidneys are usually benign and often involute over time with 
conservative management. The second most common cause of palpable abdominal mass 
in a neonate, Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney can cause respiratory distress 
secondary to extrinsic compression. However, such cases are sparse. Here we 
present the case of an otherwise healthy term newborn with an exceptionally 
large MCDK requiring CPAP support and intubation. His respiratory distress 
improved immediately after nephrectomy. Communication about cases like this will 
inform management of future comparable cases.

Nottingham, UK.

AIMS: To report the long term follow up of children with antenatally detected 
unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) with documentation of 
complications, involution rate with time, and renal function at 10 years.
METHODS: Data were retrieved from a prospective regional registry of patients 
with MCDK between 1985 and 2004. Children were followed using a common protocol 
of investigation with follow up ultrasound scans (USS) at 2 (165 patients), 5 
(117 patients), and 10 years (43 patients).
RESULTS: Serial USS showed that 33% of the MCDK kidneys had completely involuted 
at 2 years of age, 47% at 5 years, and 59% at 10 years. No patients developed 
hypertension, significant proteinuria, or malignancy, but two developed 
pelviureteric junction obstruction in the contralateral kidney. Twenty seven of 
143 children (19%) had vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (96% mild to moderate VUR) 
into the contralateral kidney with no difference in the incidence of urinary 
tract infections or renal scarring between those with or without VUR. The mean 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 86.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 (range 
48-125) in 31 of 43 patients followed to 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Conservative management of unilateral MCDK is justified with 
clinical review and infrequent USS but longer term follow up continues in the 
41% still with renal remnants at 10 years and those with impaired GFR. It is 
suggested that the initial micturating cystogram is deferred unless abnormal USS 
features are present in the contralateral kidney or ureter.

PURPOSE: The calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway regulates the transcription of 
genes important for development. It is impacted by various genetic and 
environmental factors. We investigated the potential role of NFAT induced 
transcriptional dysregulation in the pathogenesis of congenital abnormalities of 
the kidneys and urinary tract.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A murine model of conditional NFATc1 activation in 
the ureteric bud was generated and examined for histopathological changes. 
Metanephroi were also cultured in vitro to analyze branching morphogenesis in 
real time.
RESULTS: NFATc1 activation led to defects resembling multicystic dysplastic 
kidney. These mutants showed severe disorganization of branching morphogenesis 
characterized by decreased ureteric bud branching and the disconnection of 
ureteric bud derivatives from the main collecting system. The orphan ureteric 
bud derivatives may have continued to induce nephrogenesis and likely 
contributed to the subsequent formation of blunt ended filtration units and 
cysts. The ureter also showed irregularities consistent with impaired 
epithelial-mesenchymal interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the profound effects of NFAT signaling 
dysregulation on the ureteric bud and provides insight into the pathogenesis 
of multicystic dysplastic kidney. Our results suggest that the obstruction 
hypothesis and the bud theory may not be mutually exclusive to explain 
the pathogenesis of multicystic dysplastic kidney. Ureteric bud dysfunction such 
as that induced by NFAT activation can disrupt ureteric bud-metanephric 
mesenchyma interaction, causing primary defects in branching morphogenesis, 
subsequent dysplasia and cyst formation. Obstruction of the main collecting 
system can further enhance these defects, producing the pathological changes 
associated with multicystic dysplastic kidney.

Medical Centre, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.

BACKGROUND: Women with fetal multicystic dysplastic kidneys (MCDK) are commonly 
referred for genetic counseling, for which identification of the correct 
etiology is a prerequisite.
METHODS: A total of 72 women with fetal MCDK at Guangzhou Women and Children's 
Medical Center were examined via invasive prenatal diagnosis from May 2010 to 
June 2015. Standard karyotyping analysis was provided to all fetuses, and 
chromosomal microarray with Affymetrix CytoSan HD arrays was offered to cases 
whose DNA samples were available.
RESULTS: Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 3 of 72 (4.17%) fetuses. Of the 69 
(95.8%, 69/72) fetuses with normal karyotypes, 30 (42%, 30/69) underwent 
chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) testing. The CMA identified pathogenic copy 
number variations in five fetuses, leading to a pathogenic detection rate of 
16.7% (5/30). Well-known microdeletion or microduplication syndromes including 
renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome and Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) were 
identified in three cases. Moreover, four chromosomal imbalanced regions were 
also identified in our MCDK fetuses: 22q11.1 duplication, 4q35.2 deletion, 
22q13.33 duplication and 1p33 duplication. Genes PEX26, ELN, HNF1B, ALG12, FRG1, 
FRG2 and CYP4A11 were possible candidates for fetal MCDK. The proportions of 
variants of unknown significance before and after parental analysis were 13.3% 
(4/30) and 3.3% (1/30), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in 
MCDK fetuses was 4.17% and all rearrangements were imbalanced aberrations. CMA 
was able to increase the pathogenic detection rate to 16.7% in MCDK fetuses with 
normal karyotype. Critical regions for RCAD syndrome, WBS and copy number 
variants of 22q11.1 duplication, 4q35.2 deletion, 22q13.33 duplication and 1p33 
duplication were associated with fetal MCDK. Genes PEX26, ELN, HNF1B, ALG12, 
FRG1, FRG2 and CYP4A11 were possible candidates for fetal MCDK.

OBJECTIVES: Since the introduction of antenatal diagnostic screening, 
multicystic kidney dysplasia (MCKD) has been diagnosed in 1 of 4300 live births. 
We analyze our own experience and demonstrate a management regime based on these 
results and existing studies.
METHODS: Retrospective data analysis was carried out in 110 patients, prenatally 
diagnosed with MCDK. A total of 93 patients with confirmed diagnosis of 
unilateral MCDK were born alive and followed up in our institutions.
RESULTS: A total of 110 unilateral cystic kidneys were prenatally diagnosed; 93 
were confirmed postnatally. These children were retrospectively allocated to two 
treatment groups: 51 were operated upon; 42 were treated conservatively. A 
micturition cystourethrogram was performed 88 times, yielding 20 pathological 
findings. Vesicoureteral reflux was identified 11 times (12.5%). Eleven children 
(12%) had associated non-urological abnormalities. Cardiac and musculoskeletal 
malformations predominated. After 1995, nephrectomy was performed only when 
clinically indicated. Thirty-seven children were treated conservatively for 
between 4 months and 6 years (mean 33 months); 28 dysplastic kidneys exhibited 
size reduction. Complete involution was noted in 16 of 28 children between 7 and 
29 months (mean 16.2 months).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that neonatal nephrectomy of unilateral 
MCDK is rarely required. It also shows that the discussed malformation is not an 
isolated developmental abnormality. In a high proportion, associated urogenital 
abnormalities were present and therapeutically relevant, and determined the 
overall prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: Imaging of patients with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) has 
increased over the past three decades. This increased use of imaging has 
provided additional insights into the natural history of MCDK. The present study 
looked at this data for predictors of involution and associated anomalies.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this 
retrospective study. The University of Michigan Departments of Urology and 
Radiology records were searched to identify unilateral MCDK patients during 
1980-2012. Available clinical, radiological and surgical records were reviewed, 
and pertinent data were recorded. The log-rank test and a Cox proportional 
regression analysis were performed to identify predictors of MCDK involution. 
Probability of involution over time was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methodology.
RESULTS: 301 unilateral MCDKs were identified; 195 (64.8%) were detected 
antenatally. Of the MCDKs found, 136 (45.2%) were in girls; 160 (53.2%) were 
right-sided. Mean size at baseline was 5.0 ± 0.2 cm (Mean ± SE). Associated 
abnormalities included: contralateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction (n = 
10; 3.3%); contralateral ureterovesical junction obstruction/primary megaureter 
(n = 6; 2.0%); ipsilateral VUR (n = 21; 7.0%); contralateral VUR (n = 63; 
20.1%); and renal fusion anomaly (n = 4; 1.3%). The cumulative probability of 
involution was: 9.8% at one year, 38.5% at five years, and 53.5% at ten years of 
age. Baseline MCDK size was the only significant predictor of involution at 
bivariate (p < 0.0001) and multivariate (p < 0.0001; HR 0.58 [95% CI: 0.49, 
0.69]) analyses. No MCDK developed malignancy during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: As many MCDKs eventually involute and the risk of associated 
malignancy appears to be very low, there is no absolute indication for 
nephrectomy. Based on the data and other recent studies, it is believed that 
pediatric MCDK patients with no other urologic abnormalities can safely tolerate 
more limited urological and radiological follow-up.

Natural history of patients with multicystic dysplastic kidney-what followup is 
needed?

Onal B(1), Kogan BA.

PURPOSE: Most clinicians recommend followup with annual ultrasound for patients 
with multicystic dysplastic kidney. The aim of this study was to determine 
whether followup ultrasound provides any clinical benefit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 73 patients who 
were diagnosed with multicystic dysplastic kidney between October 1991 and 
August 2005. Data were analyzed with respect to patient characteristics and 
followup information.
RESULTS: We identified 61 patients (43 boys and 18 girls) with adequate 
followup. A total of 49 patients (80%) were diagnosed prenatally and 12 (20%) 
postnatally. Associated urological anomalies were noted in 16 patients (26%). 
Median followup was 2.6 years (range 6 months to 37.5 years). Ultrasound 
examinations showed complete involution in 25 patients (41%) and partial 
regression in 18 (30%). The size of the multicystic dysplastic kidney increased 
in 1 patient (1.6%) and was unchanged in 17 (28%) without any pathological 
manifestations. Median age at complete involution was 2.1 years (range 36 days 
to 13.7 years). Patients with contralateral compensatory hypertrophy had more 
rapid complete involution. Urinary tract infection developed in 6 patients, of 
whom 1 was ultimately found to have reflux and 1 had ureteropelvic junction 
obstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: In our patients with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney 
ultrasound provided little clinically important information. Our data and a 
review of the literature suggest that once the diagnosis is made, no urological 
followup is needed. The primary care provider should monitor patients with 
multicystic dysplastic kidney for hypertension, abdominal mass and urinary tract 
infection.

OBJECTIVES: To report a retrospective study of unilateral multicystic dysplastic 
kidneys (MCDK) in children, assessing the contralateral kidneys and urinary 
tract, the functional consequences, and the urological and nephrological 
management and outcome, as unilateral MCDK is the most common cause of renal 
cystic disease in children, and malformations of the contralateral urinary tract 
and kidney (pelvi-ureteric obstruction, megaureter, reflux, renal dysplasia) 
have been reported.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 97 patients (60 boys, 37 girls) with 
MCDK seen between 1985 and 1998; 82 were diagnosed in utero by ultrasonography 
(US). After birth, the diagnosis was verified by US, renal scanning (in 93) or 
intravenous urography (in four), and 89 (92%) had voiding cysto-urethrography 
(VCUG). Of the 97 children, 87 (90% had a mean (range) follow-up of 44.3 
(15-115) months.
RESULTS: The MCDK was removed in 17 children; the follow-up of 75 children (five 
lost to follow-up) showed total involution of the MCDK in 25%, shrinkage in 60% 
and a stable size in 15%. None had any sign of malignancy. The contralateral 
kidney showed anomalies in 19 of 97 children (20%); 12 had a dilated renal 
pelvis (two with megaureter), six had a high echogenicity of the contralateral 
kidney (one had reflux, and two also pelvic dilatation). In only four of the 89 
children was reflux found by VCUG; 16 of the 19 anomalies were detected by US. 
Five children needed surgery on the contralateral urinary tract (three a 
pyeloplasty, and one each a pyeloplasty plus ureteroneocystostomy, and an 
antireflux procedure). Of the contralateral kidneys 43% showed compensatory 
hypertrophy. There was mild renal insufficiency in three children; renal 
function seemed to be slightly impaired in many. Five infants had hypertension 
(four with spontaneous resolution) caused by renal scarring after pyelonephritis 
or inborn dysplasia of the contralateral kidney. There were symptomatic urinary 
tract infections in seven children.
CONCLUSION: US can be used safely to diagnose unilateral MCDKs and malformations 
of the contralateral urinary tract and kidney. In cases where US of the 
dysplastic kidney remains uncertain renal scintigraphy is necessary to detect 
the lack of renal function. The low rate of reflux makes routine VCUG 
unnecessary if the contralateral upper urinary tract and kidney appear to be 
normal on US. Nephrectomy of the dysplastic kidney in typical cases is also 
unnecessary. A long-term nephro-urological follow-up of children with MCDK is 
recommended.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Riyadh Military Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

This study reports our experience in the conservative management of multicystic 
dysplastic kidney (MCDK) disease. Between 1992 and 2003, 35 children, 18 male 
(51.4%) and 17 female (48.6%), were diagnosed with MCDK and prospectively 
followed at the Riyadh Armed Forces Hospital. Static scintigraphy with 
dimercaptosuccinic acid and micturating cystourethrogram were performed in all 
patients. Ultrasonography (US) examinations were conducted every 3 months, and 
then annually. Mean age at diagnosis during the postnatal period was 2.4 days. 
Median follow-up time was 33.75 months. Follow-up US examinations showed partial 
involution in 17 (48.6%), complete involution in 13 (37.1%), and 5 (14.3%) 
showed an unchanged size without any pathological manifestations. The mean age 
at complete or partial involution of the lesion was 43.7 months. No child 
developed complications such as hypertension or tumors, and all maintained 
normal growth and development. In conclusion, MCDK lesions are often benign, and 
the affected kidneys tend to show involution with time.

Prenatally diagnosed urinary tract abnormalities: long-term outcome.

Leeds, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, UK. d.f.m.thomas@leeds.ac.uk

The long-term outcomes of prenatally detected uropathies are poorly documented. 
Limited data on fetal intervention show a possible reduction in early mortality 
from pulmonary hypoplasia, but no beneficial effect on long-term prognosis for 
renal function. Prenatally detected vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is characterised 
by males with high-grade primary reflux, who are at long-term risk of renal 
impairment. Prenatal diagnosis and surgical intervention have contributed to a 
reduction in long-term morbidity in children with pelviureteric junction (PUJ) 
obstruction. By the same token, many children have almost certainly undergone 
unnecessary early pyeloplasty for an obstruction that would have resolved 
spontaneously. Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) carries a low (1%) risk of 
hypertension in childhood. The limited evidence on the long-term outcome of mild 
dilatation (pelvicaliectasis) indicates this is a largely innocent finding, 
which carries no increased risk of morbidity.

INTRODUCTION: Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is the most common type of 
renal cystic disease. It is associated with urinary tract abnormalities in the 
contralateral kidney in up to 30% of cases, most commonly vesicoureteral reflux 
(VUR).
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the incidence and 
selected issues in management and evolution for each VUR grade in the 
contralateral kidney of patients with unilateral MCDK, in order to strengthen 
the scientific basis regarding the need for voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) 
screening.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of standard and gray literature was performed. 
Full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal were conducted in 
duplicates. Included studies reported a primary diagnosis of unilateral MCDK 
with contralateral VUR determined by VCUG. Articles had to include a 
distribution of VUR grade to meet the eligibility criteria.
RESULTS: From 698 retrieved articles, 37 studies enrolling 2057 patients were 
analyzed. Of the patients, 80% were male; 50% had left unilateral MCDK; and 87% 
were diagnosed prenatally. A total of 1800 patients had VCUG, of whom 303 had 
VUR (weighted proportion: 17%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14-20%). Weighted 
proportions of VUR were 9%, 7%, and 17% for grades I-II, III-V, and I-V, 
respectively. Of the patients, 99% (95% CI: 97-100%) were on continuous 
antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) and 18% (95% CI: 8-37%) had urinary tract 
infections (UTIs), with a higher rate of UTIs (23% vs 10%) in patients with 
dilating (grades III-V) VUR, over a mean follow-up of 40 months. In patients 
with dilating VUR, reflux resolved or downgraded to grade I in 52% (95% CI: 
37-67%) of patients, and 32% (95% CI: 19-49%) had surgical correction of VUR.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with unilateral MCDK, 17% have VUR in the 
contralateral kidney, 41% of which is dilating VUR. Of the cases with dilating 
VUR, half will resolve or downgrade to grade I during follow-up; 23% will 
develop a UTI despite CAP; and one-third will undergo ureteral re-implantation. 
While many physicians may thus choose to forego routine VCUG screening of the 
single functional kidney, shared decision-making with the patient's caregivers 
is currently recommended, where the risks and benefits of the different 
approaches can be discussed. The data from this analysis can help inform the 
discussions.

OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively studied our cases of Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney 
(MCDK). The review was aimed at identifying the pattern of the disease in Indian 
Scenario and the required management thereof.
METHODS: We studied the clinical, radiological and nuclear scan findings of 22 
patients with unilateral MCDK. They were diagnosed and/or treated in our unit 
from 1999 to 2007. The diagnosis was achieved by Ultrasound and further 
confirmed by DMSA scans. Other ancillary investigations like Micturating 
cystourethrogram were done if indicated. These patients were followed and 
followup investigations consisted of renal ultrasound, blood pressure 
measurement, and urinalysis and blood biochemistry
RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (18 boys and 4 girls) with unilateral MCDK were 
investigated and followed for a mean period of 41 months. MCDK was detected on 
antenatal ultrasound only in 12(55%) and postnatally in 10(45%) babies. Mean age 
for postnatal diagnosis was 20 months. Follow up ultrasound revealed complete 
involution of MCDK in 3 patients and partial regression in 11 patients. The size 
of dysplastic kidney was unchanged in 4 patients and a further 4 patients 
underwent nephrectomy. Indications of nephrectomy were parental anxiety in 2, 
hypertension in 1 and palpable mass in 1.
CONCLUSION: Large proportion (45%) of patients in presented series are diagnosed 
post natally contrary to western world where more than 80% are diagnosed 
antenatally. Uncomplicated isolated MCDK carry good prognosis with nephrectomy 
required in only a few patients. Association with other urological anomalies in 
ipsilateral/contralateral genitourinary tract is important to identify as they 
have worse outcome in terms of ultimate renal function. All patients with 
simple/complex unilateral MCDK should be advised long term follow up for the 
possible development of hypertension and/or hyper infiltration injury.

Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction is a common anomaly, and presents 
clinically in all pediatric age groups. The past 3 decades have witnessed an 
evolution in the surgical correction of UPJ obstruction on several fronts, with 
open surgical techniques yielding way to endoscopic, laparoscopic, and 
robotic-assisted approaches. Robotic-assisted surgery has several advantages in 
complex laparoscopic reconstructive procedures such as pyeloplasty. Comparative 
studies of laparoscopic and robot-assisted repairs have demonstrated similar 
success rates. Laparoscopic pyeloplasty is here to stay because of its 
advantages of safety, efficacy, decreased morbidity, reduced hospital stay, and, 
perhaps most importantly, cost-effectiveness.

Robotic pyeloplasty is now commonly performed for children with ureteropelvic 
junction obstruction. Because surgical robotics is a tool that facilitates 
pyeloplasty and other reconstructive urologic operations, the indications for 
robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty are the same as those for an open 
pyeloplasty but offer distinct advantages with respect to visualization, range 
of motion, and ease of laparoscopic suturing. In this review, the authors 
discuss the operative approach for robotic pyeloplasty in children and the 
extensions of the basic techniques to challenging clinical scenarios.

Blvd., Dallas, TX 75390-9063, USA. Amy.Becker@UTSouthwestern.edu

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Antenatally detected renal abnormalities are frequently 
encountered. Recommended postnatal evaluation of these infants has evolved to 
minimize invasive testing while maximizing detection of significant 
abnormalities.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is a low rate of detectable renal abnormalities in 
infants with a normal postnatal sonogram at 4-6 weeks of age. Routine 
prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated in infants with isolated antenatal 
hydronephrosis. Infants with a multicystic dysplastic kidney and a normal 
contralateral kidney on renal ultrasound do not require further evaluation. 
Parents of these children should be counseled on symptoms of urinary tract 
infections to allow prompt diagnosis.
SUMMARY: All infants with abnormalities on antenatal sonogram should undergo 
postnatal evaluation with a sonogram after birth and at 4-6 weeks of age. 
Further evaluation can be safely limited when the postnatal sonogram is normal 
at 6 weeks of age.

Renal dysplasia is a common abnormality in children. The role of MRI in 
evaluating children with renal dysplasia is evolving. More information is 
clearly necessary before MRI replaces conventional imaging modalities. In order 
to appropriately use MRI, the radiologist must have an understanding of the 
clinical questions that are important in the management of children with renal 
dysplasia. This review provides background information on renal dysplasia for 
the pediatric radiologist. The focus is on unilateral disease, especially 
multicystic dysplastic kidneys, and bilateral dysplasia, which is the most 
common cause of kidney failure in children. The emphasis is on the important 
clinical issues, and the potential of MRI as a methodology for providing 
clinically useful information not otherwise available from other imaging 
modalities.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is one of the most common fetal 
malformations, but its etiology remains unclear. Identification of the molecular 
etiology could provide a basis for prenatal diagnosis, consultation, and 
prognosis evaluation for MCDK fetuses. We used chromosome microarray analysis 
(CMA) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) to conduct genetic tests on MCDK fetuses 
and explore their genetic etiology. A total of 108 MCDK fetuses with or without 
other extrarenal abnormalities were selected. Karyotype analysis of 108 MCDK 
fetuses showed an abnormal karyotype in 4 (3.7%, 4/108) of the fetuses. However, 
CMA detected 15 abnormal copy number variations (CNVs) (14 pathogenic CNVs, and 
one variant of unknown significance [VUS] CNVs), in addition to four cases that 
were consistent with the results of karyotype analysis. Out of the 14 pathogenic 
CNVs cases, three were of 17q12 microdeletion, two of 22q11.21 microdeletion, 
22q11.21 microduplication uniparental disomy (UPD), and one case of 4q31.3q32.2 
microdeletion, 7q11.23 microduplication, 15q11.2 microdeletion, 16p11.2 
microdeletion, and 17p12 microdeletion. Of the 89 MCDK fetuses with normal 
karyotype analysis and CMA, 15 were tested by WES. Two (13.3%, 2/15) fetuses 
were identified by WES as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) 1 and BBS2. Combined 
application of CMA-WES to detect MCDK fetuses can significantly improve the 
detection rate of genetic etiology, providing a basis for consultation, and 
prognosis evaluation.

INTRODUCTION: Wnt-1 is capable of inducing metanephric mesenchyme to undergo 
tubulogenesis. A relationship between the degree of cystogenesis and reduced 
E-cadherin (E-cad) expression was described. Syndecan-1 (Sdc-1) has a critical 
role in kidney development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten multicystic dysplastic kidneys (MCDKs) were stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry was performed using Wnt-1, 
E-cad and Sdc-1 antibodies. Eight unaffected kidneys were used as controls.
RESULTS: Strong Wnt-1 immunostaining occurred inside cystic/tubular epithelial 
cells and in blastematous foci. An immunoreaction was observed in glomerular 
epithelial cells. In controls, just weak cytoplasmic Wnt-1 positivity was seen 
in tubular epithelial cells. E-cad reaction was negative in MCDKs while strong 
immunostaining was common in tubular cells of controls. A strong Sdc-1 
immunoreaction depicted cystic, tubular and glomerular epithelial cells in MCDKs 
while Sdc-1 expression documented weak positivity in tubular epithelium alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data are in accordance with an involvement of Wnt-1 in normal 
nephrogenesis and with its role in altered epithelial differentiation of 
metanephric mesenchyme in MCDKs. Wnt-1 signal may function to suppress E-cad 
expression, a predisposing event for cystogenesis. High expression of Sdc-1 in 
tubular/cystic epithelial cells of MCDKs might alter the normal transition of 
stages of the developmental process and modify the anion charge of the 
glomerular barrier.

Objective Surgery is still indicated as the treatment of choice in subset of 
patients with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (UMCDK) because of its 
potential complications and malignant change. The purpose of this study is to 
present our observation that early nephrectomy may cure hypertension early in 
children with UMCDK and review the literature. Materials and Methods We report 
here four children (two males and two females) with antenatally diagnosed UMCDK 
with hypertension, treated in the past 4 years. All have antenatal diagnosis of 
UMCDK and referred to us after their birth. Diagnosis of hypertension (blood 
pressure > 95th percentile) was made after 3 months of follow-up in all 
patients. Nephrectomy was performed in all children in variable time duration. 
Hypertension, urinary tract infection, and desire of parents were the main 
indication of surgery. Results All children showed decrease in the size of their 
dysplastic kidney with time, but hypertension was persistent and needed 
antihypertensive drugs; even increase in the doses in successive follow-up. 
After nephrectomy, three children who were operated early got cured having 
normal blood pressure within variable time duration, while a child, operated 
late, still had high blood pressure and needed antihypertensive drugs. 
Conclusion Early nephrectomy in recently diagnosed hypertension in UMCDK is 
advisable and can cure hypertension early. Levels of Evidence The level of 
evidence is IV (case series with no comparison group).

INTRODUCTION: While children with multicystic dysplastic kidneys (MCDK) are 
predisposed to contralateral kidney (CK) vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), it is 
unknown if this results in an increased risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). 
The authors hypothesized that knowledge of VUR via voiding cystourethrogram 
(VCUG) would enable altered practices to prevent UTI and thus reduce the number 
of febrile urinary tract infections (fUTIs).
METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of all patients at 
their institution of multiple providers caring for patients with a diagnosis of 
MCDK from 1/1/07 to 7/14/17. Patients were evaluated for age, sex, circumcision 
status, race, imaging results on renal ultrasound (RUS) and/or VCUG, occurrence 
of fUTI, and prophylactic antibiotic (ppx) use.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five patients were identified; 70% of patients were 
diagnosed with MCDK on prenatal imaging. Seventy-seven (47%) patients had a 
screening VCUG after diagnosis of MCDK. Eighteen patients with VCUG had VUR with 
13 (17%) having VUR in the CK. Only children undergoing VCUG were placed on ppx 
with no difference in the use of ppx in patients with and without dilating VUR 
(45% vs 43%; p = 0.91). Overall, 11 patients experienced a fUTI. There was no 
significant difference in fUTI between those children who underwent VCUG 
compared with those who did not (10% vs 3%; p = 0.07). Use of ppx and presence 
of CK renal anomaly on RUS had no impact on incidence of subsequent fUTI.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge of VUR based on VCUG results did not reduce the rate of 
fUTI or predict ppx use in the practice of multiple providers. The authors feel 
this confirms the low utility of VCUG in the practical management of otherwise 
healthy children with MCDK.

OBJECTIVE: Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is one of the most common 
anomalies detected by prenatal ultrasound. Our objective was to identify factors 
associated with severe adverse neonatal outcomes of prenatally diagnosed MCDK 
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of prenatally diagnosed MCDK (1 January 
2009 to 30 December 2014) from a single academic center was conducted. The 
primary outcome was death or need for dialysis among live-born infants. 
Associations between prenatal characteristics and outcome were analyzed by 
Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney test.
RESULTS: A total of 53 cases of prenatally suspected MCDK were included, of 
which 46 cases were live-born and confirmed postnatally (38 survivors, 8 
non-survivors). Prenatally diagnosed extrarenal anomalies, bilateral MCDK, 
contralateral renal anomalies, and anhydramnios were significantly associated 
with death or need for dialysis (all p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatally identified findings are associated with adverse neonatal 
outcome, and can guide counseling and management planning. In the absence of 
significant associated findings, prenatally diagnosed unilateral MCDK has a 
benign neonatal course.

We present an adult case of segmental multicystic dysplastic kidney (SMCDK). The 
patient had a 10 × 6 cm oval-shaped mass consisting of a solid and multilocular 
cystic component at the right upper renal sinus. The solid component showed 
gradual and mild enhancement on dual-phase enhanced CT. Excretory-phase CT 
demonstrated the excretion of contrast medium into the septa and cysts. Dilation 
of the upper calices and renal pelvis and atretic renal pelvis in the mass were 
also clearly visualized in the excretory phase. The signal intensity of the 
solid component was slightly lower than that of the renal parenchyma on 
T2-weighted images and similar to that of the medulla on diffusion-weighted 
images. Right nephrectomy showed a multilocular cystic component within the 
renal sinus and some of the cysts contained blood. The renal pelvis of the upper 
moiety was blind, as suggested by CT. Microscopically, there were multiple 
non-communicating small cysts, as shown by CT, and the wall was lined with 
immature tubule-like cells. In addition, immature tubule-like cells were seen in 
the septa. Immature mesenchymal cells were seen around the cysts. The solid 
component mainly consisted of fibroconnective tissue with immature tubule-like 
cells. The pathological diagnosis was confirmed as SMCDK. Excretion of contrast 
media into the septum and cystic component might be a characteristic finding of 
SMCDK in addition to the finding of a multilocular cystic mass in the upper 
moiety with urinary tract abnormality.

Trajectory of Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Predicts Renal Injury in 
Children with Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney.

Matsumura K, Sugii K, Awazu M.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Children with a solitary functioning kidney have a risk of 
renal injury caused by hyperfiltration. Timely intervention with 
renin-angiotensin inhibitors may be beneficial. We examined whether trajectory 
of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) would predict renal injury, 
defined as microalbuminuria/proteinuria, hypertension, and/or a decline in eGFR.
METHODS: Seventeen patients (male 7, female 10) with multicystic dysplastic 
kidney (MCDK; median age 13 years, range 6-19 years) followed in our clinic were 
examined retrospectively. An eGFR decline was defined as a fall to < 90 
mL/min/1.73 m2 or a decline of > 5 mL/min/1.73 m2/year for those with baseline 
eGFR of ≥90 or < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 respectively.
RESULTS: Nine patients had renal injury at the time of investigation. Compared 
with 8 patients without renal injury, those with renal injury tended to be older 
(14.7 ± 4.2 vs. 11.4 ± 4.6 years) and the birth weight was smaller (2,538 ± 281 
vs. 2,966 ± 361 g, p < 0.05). The frequency of contralateral congenital anomaly 
of kidney and urinary tract (cyst, hydronephrosis, or vesicoureteral reflux) 
were not different. The trajectory of eGFR in those without renal injury was 
either an increase (n = 3) or unidentifiable (n = 5), whereas that in the renal 
injury group was exclusively an increase followed by decline (p < 0.05). The 
average age of the onset of eGFR decline was 9.4 ± 4.2 years and that of the 
start of renal injury (albuminuria/proteinuria 5, eGFR decline 4, hypertension 
1) was 12.5 ± 4.2 years.
CONCLUSION: All the children with MCDK who developed renal injury had eGFR 
trajectory of increase followed by decline. Renal injury followed the peak eGFR 
by 3 years on average. This observation is in agreement with the hyperfiltration 
theory and underscores the importance of following eGFR trajectory closely.

Eccrine nevi are rare hamartomas characterized by an increase in the number or 
size of eccrine glands. A polypoid form located in the coccygeal area has been 
described in a few cases and termed coccygeal polypoid eccrine nevus (CPEN). No 
association with internal malformations was reported in any of these cases. We 
describe herein a case of CPEN associated with imperforate anus and unilateral 
multicystic kidney dysplasia. We review the clinical and pathological 
characteristics of CPENs and discuss the differential diagnoses.

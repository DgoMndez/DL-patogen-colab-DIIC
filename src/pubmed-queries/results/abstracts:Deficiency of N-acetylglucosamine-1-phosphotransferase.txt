Mucolipidosis II and III (ML II/III) are caused by a deficiency of 
uridine-diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine: 
lysosomal-enzyme-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase 
(GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, EC2.7.8.17), which tags lysosomal enzymes with a 
mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) marker for transport to the lysosome. The process is 
performed by a sequential two-step process: first, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase 
catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc-1-phosphate to the selected mannose residues on 
lysosomal enzymes in the cis-Golgi network. The second step removes GlcNAc from 
lysosomal enzymes by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester 
α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (uncovering enzyme) and exposes the mannose 
6-phosphate (M6P) residues in the trans-Golgi network, in which the enzymes are 
targeted to the lysosomes by M6Preceptors. A deficiency of 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase causes the hypersecretion of lysosomal enzymes out 
of cells, resulting in a shortage of multiple lysosomal enzymes within 
lysosomes. Due to a lack of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, the accumulation of 
cholesterol, phospholipids, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and other undegraded 
substrates occurs in the lysosomes. Clinically, ML II and ML III exhibit quite 
similar manifestations to mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs), including specific 
skeletal deformities known as dysostosis multiplex and gingival hyperplasia. The 
life expectancy is less than 10 years in the severe type, and there is no 
definitive treatment for this disease. In this review, we have described the 
updated diagnosis and therapy on ML II/III.

Modification of the carbohydrate chains of soluble lysosomal enzymes with 
mannose 6-phosphate residues is a prerequisite for their mannose 6-phosphate 
receptor-dependent transport to lysosomes. GlcNac-1-phosphotransferase localized 
in the Golgi apparatus represents a hexameric alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) subunit 
complex and plays a key role in the formation of the mannose 6-phosphate 
recognition marker. Defects in the GlcNac-1-phosphotransferase complex cause two 
diseases, mucolipidosis type II and III, which are characterized by missorting 
and cellular loss of lysosomal enzymes, and lysosomal accumulation of storage 
material. The recent identification of two genes, GNPTAB and GNPTG, encoding the 
three subunits of GlcNac-1-phosphotransferase leads to an improvement of both 
pre- and postnatal diagnosis of affected individuals, and permits the analysis 
of structural requirements for efficient formation of mannose 6-phosphate 
residues on lysosomal enzymes. The alpha/beta subunits precursor matures by 
proteolytic cleavage and contains the catalytic activity as well as the 
capability to recognize lysosomal enzymes. The role of the gamma-subunits for 
activity, stability and oligomerization of the GlcNac-1-phosphotransferase 
subunits is still unclear.

The mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) biosynthetic pathway for lysosome biogenesis has 
been studied for decades and is considered a well-understood topic. However, 
whether this pathway is regulated remains an open question. In a genome-wide 
CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, we discover TMEM251 as the first regulator of the 
M6P modification. Deleting TMEM251 causes mistargeting of most lysosomal enzymes 
due to their loss of M6P modification and accumulation of numerous undigested 
materials. We further demonstrate that TMEM251 localizes to the Golgi and is 
required for the cleavage and activity of GNPT, the enzyme that catalyzes M6P 
modification. In zebrafish, TMEM251 deletion leads to severe developmental 
defects including heart edema and skeletal dysplasia, which phenocopies 
Mucolipidosis Type II. Our discovery provides a mechanism for the newly 
discovered human disease caused by TMEM251 mutations. We name TMEM251 as GNPTAB 
cleavage and activity factor (GCAF) and its related disease as Mucolipidosis 
Type V.

Sialidoses are autosomal recessive disorders caused by NEU1 gene mutations and 
are classified on the basis of their phenotype and onset age. Sialidosis type 
II, with infantile onset, has a more severe phenotype characterized by coarse 
facial features, hepatomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, and developmental delay 
while patients with the late and milder type, known as "cherry red 
spot-myoclonus syndrome" develop myoclonic epilepsy, visual impairment and 
ataxia in the second or third decade of life. The diagnosis is usually suggested 
by increased urinary bound sialic acid excretion. We recently described 
genetically diagnosed patients with a specially mild phenotype, no retinal 
abnormalities and normal urinary sialic acid. This observation suggests that 
genetic analysis or the demonstration of the neuraminidase enzyme deficiency in 
cultured fibroblasts are needed to detect and diagnose mildest phenotypes.

Mucolipidosis type III gamma (MLIII, pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy) is a rare 
autosomal recessive disorder where the activity of the multimeric 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase is reduced and formation of the mannose 6-phosphate 
(M6P) recognition marker on lysosomal enzymes is impaired. In this disease, the 
targeting of lysosomal enzymes is affected resulting in their hypersecretion, 
and an intracellular deficiency of multiple hydrolases. We report the 
biochemical and molecular diagnosis of MLIII in three siblings, aged 17, 15, and 
14 years, who presented with joint pain and progressive joint stiffness. In 
addition to missorting of newly synthesized lysosomal protease cathepsin D, 
there were low levels of M6P-containing proteins in cell extracts and media of 
cultured fibroblasts of the Patients. Direct sequencing identified a novel 
homozygous mutation in intron 7, IVS7-10G>A, of the GNPTG gene, which encodes 
the gamma-subunit of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This mutation created a 
cryptic 3'-splice site resulting in a frameshift and premature translational 
termination (p.V176GfsX18). The GNPTG mRNA levels were markedly reduced in 
Patients' fibroblasts indicating that the intronic mutation mediates mRNA decay, 
which was confirmed by absence of the gamma-subunit protein. These data 
contribute to an efficient diagnostic strategy to identify Patients with MLIII 
gamma and characterize their biochemical defect in fibroblasts.

Mucolipidoses II and III (ML II and ML III) are lysosomal disorders in which the 
mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker is absent from lysosomal hydrolases and 
other glycoproteins due to mutations in GNPTAB, which encodes two of three 
subunits of the heterohexameric enzyme, 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. Both disorders are caused by the same 
gene, but ML II represents the more severe phenotype. Bone manifestations of ML 
II include hip dysplasia, scoliosis, rickets and osteogenesis imperfecta. In 
this study, we sought to determine whether a recombinant adeno-associated viral 
vector (AAV2/8-GNPTAB) could confer high and prolonged gene expression of GNPTAB 
and thereby influence the pathology in the cartilage and bone tissue of a GNPTAB 
knock out (KO) mouse model. The results demonstrated significant increases in 
bone mineral density and content in AAV2/8-GNPTAB-treated as compared to 
non-treated KO mice. We also showed that IL-6 (interleukin-6) expression in 
articular cartilage was reduced in AAV2/8-GNPTAB treated ML II mice. Together, 
these data suggest that AAV-mediated expression of GNPTAB in ML II mice can 
attenuate bone loss via inhibition of IL-6 production. This study emphasizes the 
value of the MLII KO mouse to recapitulate the clinical manifestations of the 
disease and highlights its amenability to therapy.

Mucolipidoses (ML) II and III alpha/beta are lysosomal storage diseases caused 
by pathogenic mutations in GNPTAB encoding the α⁄β-subunit precursor of 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. To determine genotype-phenotype correlation and 
functional analysis of mutant GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, 13 Brazilian patients 
clinically and biochemical diagnosed for MLII or III alpha/beta were studied. By 
sequencing of genomic GNPTAB of the MLII and MLIII alpha/beta patients we 
identified six novel mutations: p.D76G, p.S385L, p.Q278Kfs*3, p.H588Qfs*27, 
p.N642Lfs*10 and p.Y1111*. Expression analysis by western blotting and 
immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the mutant α⁄β-subunit precursor 
p.D76G is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum whereas the mutant p.S385L is 
correctly transported to the cis-Golgi apparatus and proteolytically processed. 
Both mutations lead to complete loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity, 
consistent with the severe clinical MLII phenotype of the patients. Our study 
expands the genotypic spectrum of MLII and provides novel insights into 
structural requirements to ensure GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity.

Phosphorylation of lysosomal enzymes in fibroblasts. Marked deficiency of 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase in fibroblasts of patients with 
mucolipidosis III.

Waheed A, Hasilik A, Cantz M, von Figura K.

N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase activity was assayed in human skin 
fibroblasts using [beta-32P]UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as donor and 
dephosphorylated beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase as acceptor. An optimal transfer 
rate of N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate required CDP-choline and ADP in order to 
inhibit the breakdown of [beta-32P]UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and a combination of 
leupeptin and iodoacetamide to protect the transferase. The transferase required 
Mg2 or Mn2. Using doubly labelled UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, simultaneous transfer 
of N-acetyl-[6-3H]glucosamine and [32P]phosphate to endogenous acceptors was 
demonstrated. Membranes prepared from fibroblasts from patients with 
mucolipidosis III were defective in transfer of N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate. 
A residual transferase activity of less than 10% of controls was detectable in 
fibroblast membranes of eight patients with mucolipidosis III. In membranes from 
fibroblasts from patients with mucolipidosis 
II,N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase activity was not detectable. Our 
results indicate that the primary defect in mucolipidoses II and III is a 
deficiency in N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, the residual activity 
being higher in mucolipidosis III than in mucolipidosis II.

In a screen of signal peptide-containing proteins from a mouse hypothetical 
protein library, we identified the mouse UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase-gamma chain 
(GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-gamma) (GenBank accession no. , HYP36 in this 
study). The mouse GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-gamma was localized in the Golgi 
complex in cells and was expressed ubiquitously in mouse tissues, as shown by 
fluorescence microscope analysis and a semi-quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, respectively. Domain 
analysis showed that the mouse GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-gamma had a conserved 
mannose-6-phosphate (M-6-P)-binding domain. Interestingly, we found that 
overexpression of the mouse GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-gamma in fibroblast cell 
line NIH-3T3 induced accumulation of macromolecules, formation of large 
cytoplasmic vacuoles and decrease of lysosomal enzymes in cells. This phenotype 
was reminiscent of inclusion cells (I-cells) that were reported in mucolipidosis 
diseases caused by abnormal sorting of lysosomal proteins. Transient ectopic 
expression of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-gamma in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
induced lowered lysosomal enzyme activity in cells. These results suggested on 
one hand that GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-gamma is an essential subunit of the 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, and on the other hand, the molecule might not only 
recognize the substrates of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, but also the lysosomal 
proteins with M-6-P residuals.

Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are evolutionarily conserved 
integral membrane proteins. The mammalian TRP superfamily of ion channels 
consists of 28 cation permeable channels that are grouped into six subfamilies 
based on sequence homology (Fig. 6.1). The canonical TRP (TRPC) subfamily is 
known for containing the founding member of mammalian TRP channels. The 
vanilloid TRP (TRPV) subfamily has been extensively studied due to the heat 
sensitivity of its founding member. The melastatin-related TRP (TRPM) subfamily 
includes some of the few known bi-functional ion channels, which contain 
functional enzymatic domains. The ankyrin TRP (TRPA) subfamily consists of a 
single chemo-nociceptor that has been proposed to be a target for analgesics. 
The mucolipin TRP (TRPML) subfamily channels are found primarily in 
intracellular compartments and were discovered based on their critical role in 
type IV mucolipidosis (ML-IV). The polycystic TRP (TRPP) subfamily is a diverse 
group of proteins implicated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 
(ADPKD). Overall, this superfamily of channels is involved in a vast array of 
physiological and pathophysiological processes making the study of these 
channels imperative to our understanding of subcellular biochemistry.

Mucolipidosis type II (ML II; I-cell disease) and mucolipidosis III (ML III; 
pseudo Hurler polydystrophy) are autosomal recessively inherited disorders 
caused by a defective N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase 
(phosphotransferase). The formation of mannose 6-phosphate markers in soluble 
lysosomal enzymes is impeded leading to their increased excretion into the 
serum, to cellular deficiency of multiple hydrolases, and lysosomal storage of 
non-digested material. Phosphotransferase deficiency is caused by mutations in 
GNPTA and GNPTG encoding phosphotransferase subunits. Here we report on an 
adolescent with progressive joint contractions and other signs of mucolipidosis 
II who survived to the age of 14 years. Impaired trafficking of lysosomal 
enzymes cathepsin D and -hexosaminidase in metabolically labeled fibroblasts was 
documented. Mutations in the GNPTG gene and alterations in the GNPTG mRNA level 
were not detected. A different electrophoretic mobility of the 97 kDa GNPTG 
dimer suggested posttranslational modification abrogating the 
compartmentalization of GNPTG in the Golgi apparatus. A nucleotide substitution 
in the GNPTA gene (c.3707A>T) was identified altering the predicted C-terminal 
transmembrane anchor of the phosphotransferase subunit. The data demonstrate 
that defective GNPTA not only impairs lysosomal enzyme targeting but also the 
availability of intact GNPTG required for phosphotransferase activity and 
assembly of subunits.

Lysosomes are cell organelles that degrade macromolecules to recycle their 
components. If lysosomal degradative function is impaired, e.g., due to 
mutations in lysosomal enzymes or membrane proteins, lysosomal storage diseases 
(LSDs) can develop. LSDs manifest often with neurodegenerative symptoms, 
typically starting in early childhood, and going along with a strongly reduced 
life expectancy and quality of life. We show here that small molecule activation 
of the Ca2+ -permeable endolysosomal two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) results in an 
amelioration of cellular phenotypes associated with LSDs such as cholesterol or 
lipofuscin accumulation, or the formation of abnormal vacuoles seen by electron 
microscopy. Rescue effects by TPC2 activation, which promotes lysosomal 
exocytosis and autophagy, were assessed in mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), 
Niemann-Pick type C1, and Batten disease patient fibroblasts, and in neurons 
derived from newly generated isogenic human iPSC models for MLIV and Batten 
disease. For in vivo proof of concept, we tested TPC2 activation in the MLIV 
mouse model. In sum, our data suggest that TPC2 is a promising target for the 
treatment of different types of LSDs, both in vitro and in-vivo.

The lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis III αβ is caused by mutations in 
the αβ subunits of UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (phosphotransferase). This 
Golgi-localized enzyme mediates the first step in the synthesis of the mannose 
6-phosphate recognition marker on lysosomal acid hydrolases, and loss of 
function results in impaired lysosomal targeting of these acid hydrolases and 
decreased lysosomal degradation. Here we show that two patient missense 
mutations, Lys4Gln and Ser15Tyr, in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the α 
subunit of phosphotransferase impair retention of the catalytically active 
enzyme in the Golgi complex. This results in mistargeting of the mutant 
phosphotransferases to lysosomes, where they are degraded, or to the cell 
surface and release into the medium. The finding that mislocalization of active 
phosphotransferase is the basis for mucolipidosis III αβ in a subset of patients 
shows the importance of single residues in the cytoplasmic tail of a 
Golgi-resident protein for localization to this compartment.

Mucopolysaccharidoses and mucolipidoses.

Wraith JE(1).

The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) and mucolipidoses (ML) are progressive storage 
disorders that share many clinical features varying from facial dysmorphism, 
bone dysplasia, hepatosplenomegaly, neurological abnormalities, developmental 
regression, and a reduced life expectancy at the severe end of the clinical 
spectrum to an almost normal clinical phenotype and life span in patients with 
more attenuated disease. MPS and ML are transmitted in an autosomal recessive 
manner, except for the X-linked MPS II (Hunter syndrome). Diagnosis is initially 
by detecting partially degraded GAG or oligosaccharide in urine and confirmed by 
specific enzyme assays in serum, leukocytes, or skin fibroblasts. For the 
majority of disorders treatment is palliative, but there have been important 
advances in the use of specific enzyme replacement therapy strategies for some 
MPS disorders and this is an area of very rapid development. In addition, 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can improve outcome in carefully 
selected patients with MPS (especially MPS IH, Hurler syndrome), but this 
procedure is associated with significant risk. Gene augmentation/transfer using 
a variety of vectors has been successful in animal models but has not yet been 
successfully performed in a human patient with one of these disorders. It is 
important to remember that prenatal diagnosis is possible for all of these 
disorders.

Degradation of macromolecules delivered to lysosomes by processes such as 
autophagy or endocytosis is crucial for cellular function. Lysosomes require 
more than 60 soluble hydrolases in order to catabolize such macromolecules. 
These soluble hydrolases are tagged with mannose6-phosphate (M6P) moieties in 
sequential reactions by the Golgi-resident GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex 
and NAGPA/UCE/uncovering enzyme (N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester 
alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase), which allows their delivery to 
endosomal/lysosomal compartments through trafficking mediated by 
cation-dependent and -independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs). We and 
others recently identified TMEM251 as a novel regulator of the M6P pathway via 
independent genome-wide genetic screening strategies. We renamed TMEM251 to 
LYSET (lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor) to establish nomenclature reflective 
to this gene's function. LYSET is a Golgi-localized transmembrane protein 
important for the retention of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex in the 
Golgi-apparatus. The current understanding of LYSET's importance regarding human 
biology is 3-fold: 1) highly pathogenic viruses that depend on lysosomal 
hydrolase activity require LYSET for infection. 2) The presence of LYSET is 
critical for cancer cell proliferation in nutrient-deprived environments in 
which extracellular proteins must be catabolized. 3) Inherited pathogenic 
alleles of LYSET can cause a severe inherited disease which resembles 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase deficiency (i.e., mucolipidosis type 
II).Abbreviations: GlcNAc-1-PT: GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase; KO: knockout; LSD:

Mucolipidosis II: a single causal mutation in the 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase gene (GNPTAB) in a French Canadian

Mucolipidosis (ML) II (I-cell disease) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by 
a deficiency of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. MLII is an autosomal recessive disease 
with a carrier rate estimated at 1/39 in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (SLSJ) (Quebec, 
Canada), which is the highest frequency documented worldwide. To identify the 
causing mutation, we sequenced GNPTAB exons in 27 parents of 16 MLII-deceased 
children from the SLSJ region as obligatory and potential carriers. We also 
performed a genealogical reconstruction for each parent to evaluate 
consanguinity levels and genetic contribution of ancestors. Our goal was to 
identify which parameters could explain the high MLII frequency observed in the 
SLSJ population. A single mutation (c.3503_3504delTC) was found in all 
obligatory carriers. In addition, 11 apparent polymorphisms were identified. The 
mutation was not detected in genomic DNA of 50 unrelated controls. Genealogical 
data show six founders (three couples) with a higher probability of having 
introduced the mutation in the population. The frequency of the mutation was 
increased as a consequence of this founder effect and of the resulting 
population structure. We suggest that c.3503_3504delTC is the allele causing 
MLII in the SLSJ population, and its high carrier rate is most likely explained 
by a founder effect.

In the group of lysosomal storage diseases, transport disorders occupy a special 
place because they represent rare examples of inborn errors of metabolism caused 
by a defect of an intracellular membrane transporter. In particular, two 
disorders are caused by a proven defect in carrier-mediated transport of 
metabolites: cystinosis and the group of sialic acid storage disorders (SASD). 
The recent identification of the gene mutations for both disorders will improve 
patient diagnosis and shed light on new physiological mechanisms of 
intracellular trafficking.

UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase tags newly synthesized 
lysosomal enzymes with mannose 6-phosphate recognition markers, which are 
required for their targeting to the endolysosomal system. GNPTAB encodes the α 
and β subunits of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, and mutations in this gene cause 
the lysosomal storage disorders mucolipidosis II and III αβ. Prior investigation 
of missense mutations in GNPTAB uncovered amino acids in the N-terminal region 
and within the DMAP domain involved in Golgi retention of 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase and its ability to specifically recognize lysosomal 
hydrolases, respectively. Here, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of the 
remaining missense mutations in GNPTAB reported in mucolipidosis II and III αβ 
patients using cell- and zebrafish-based approaches. We show that the Stealth 
domain harbors the catalytic site, as some mutations in these regions greatly 
impaired the activity of the enzyme without affecting its Golgi localization and 
proteolytic processing. We also demonstrate a role for the Notch repeat 1 in 
lysosomal hydrolase recognition, as missense mutations in conserved cysteine 
residues in this domain do not affect the catalytic activity but impair mannose 
phosphorylation of certain lysosomal hydrolases. Rescue experiments using mRNA 
bearing Notch repeat 1 mutations in GNPTAB-deficient zebrafish revealed 
selective effects on hydrolase recognition that differ from the DMAP mutation. 
Finally, the mutant R587P, located in the spacer between Notch 2 and DMAP, was 
partially rescued by overexpression of the γ subunit, suggesting a role for this 
region in γ subunit binding. These studies provide new insight into the 
functions of the different domains of the α and β subunits.

Mucolipidosis type IV.

Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder 
characterized by psychomotor retardation and ophthalmological abnormalities, 
including corneal opacities, retinal degeneration, and strabismus. Severely 
affected as well as milder patients have been described. Over 80% of the MLIV 
patients are Ashkenazi Jews; the estimated heterozygote frequency in this 
population is 1/100. The disease is classified as a mucolipidosis due to the 
simultaneous lysosomal storage of lipids together with water-soluble substances. 
A broad spectrum of lipids and acid mucopolysaccharides were identified as the 
storage substances. Kinetic studies demonstrated that this heterogeneous storage 
stems from an abnormal endocytosis process in cells from MLIV patients of 
membrane components from late endosomes to the lysosomes and/or delayed efflux 
to the Golgi apparatus. The MLIV gene was mapped to chromosome 19p13.2--13.3 
where a novel gene, MCOLN1, with MLIV-causing mutations, was identified. Two 
mutations were found among 95% of the Ashkenazi MLIV alleles, including an 
intronic acceptor splice-site mutation in 72% of the alleles and a partial gene 
deletion in 23%. Each of these mutations was associated with a defined haplotype 
in this chromosomal region. Other mutations were mostly identified in single, 
Ashkenazi and non-Ashkanazi patients, including missense, nonsense nucleotide 
deletions, and insertions. All mutations but one were identified in patients 
exhibiting the severe phenotype, an in-frame amino acid deletion was identified 
in a mild patient. MCOLN1 encodes a 580 aa protein, mucolipin 1, which is a 
member of a new protein family of unknown function at present, the mucolipins. 
Mucolipin 1 is a membrane protein with 6 transmembrane domains, a serine lipase, 
and nuclear localization signal motives. The protein shows homology to a group 
of calcium channels of the TRP/TRPL family. The involvement of this protein in 
the endocytosis process of membrane components is currently studied. A 
population screening operation among the Ashkenazi population for the detection 
of heterozygotes has been started in Israel as a prevention program.

Lysosomal hydrolases catalyze the degradation of a variety of macromolecules 
including proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and lipids. The biogenesis of 
lysosomes or lysosome-related organelles requires a continuous substitution of 
soluble acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane proteins. The targeting of 
lysosomal hydrolases depends on mannose 6-phosphate residues (M6P) that are 
recognized by specific receptors mediating their transport to an 
endosomal/prelysosomal compartment. The key role in the formation of M6P 
residues plays the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase localized in the Golgi apparatus. 
Two genes have been identified recently encoding the type III alpha/beta-subunit 
precursor membrane protein and the soluble gamma-subunit of 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. Mutations in these genes result in two severe 
diseases, mucolipidosis type II (MLII) and III (MLIII), biochemically 
characterized by the missorting of multiple lysosomal hydrolases due to impaired 
formation of the M6P recognition marker, and general lysosomal dysfunction. This 
review gives an update on structural properties, localization and functions of 
the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase subunits and improvements of pre- and postnatal 
diagnosis of ML patients. Further, the generation of recombinant single-chain 
antibody fragments against M6P residues and of new mouse models of MLII and 
MLIII will have considerable impact to provide deeper insight into the cell 
biology of lysosomal dysfunctions and the pathomechanisms underlying these 
lysosomal disorders.

Missense mutations in N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase alpha/beta 
subunit gene in a patient with mucolipidosis III and a mild clinical phenotype.

Mucolipidosis type III (ML III, pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy), an autosomal 
recessive inherited disorder of lysosomal enzyme targeting is due to a defective 
N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase (phosphotransferase) activity and leads 
to the impaired formation of mannose 6-phosphate markers in soluble lysosomal 
enzymes followed by their increased excretion into the serum. Mutations in the 
phosphotransferase gamma subunit gene (GNPTAG) have been reported to be 
responsible for ML III. Here we report on a 14-year-old adolescent with a mild 
clinical phenotype of ML III. He presented with progressive joint stiffness and 
swelling. Urinary oligosaccharide and mucopolysaccharide excretion was normal. 
Lysosomal enzyme activities were significantly elevated in the serum and 
decreased in cultured fibroblasts. Impaired trafficking of the lysosomal 
protease cathepsin D (CtsD) was confirmed by metabolic labeling of the patient's 
fibroblasts. Neither mutations in the GNPTAG gene nor alterations in the GNPTAG 
mRNA level were detected whereas the steady state concentration of the 97 kDa 
GNPTAG dimer was reduced. Most importantly, the patient is homozygous for a 
pathogenic nucleotide substitution and a polymorphism in the phosphotransferase 
alpha/beta subunit gene (GNPTA). The data indicate that defects in genes other 
than GNPTAG can be linked to ML III contributing to the variability of the 
phenotype.

Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is a neurodevelopmental as well as 
neurodegenerative disorder with severe psychomotor developmental delay, 
progressive visual impairment, and achlorydria. It is characterized by the 
presence of lysosomal inclusions in many cell types in patients. MLIV is an 
autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in MCOLN1, which encodes for 
mucolipin-1, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel 
family. Although approximately 70-80% of patients identified are Ashkenazi 
Jewish, MLIV is a pan-ethnic disorder. Importantly, while MLIV is thought to be 
a rare disease, its frequency may be greater than currently appreciated, for its 
common presentation as a cerebral palsy-like encephalopathy can lead to 
misdiagnosis. Moreover, patients with milder variants are often not recognized 
as having MLIV. This review provides an update on the ethnic distribution, 
clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, methods of diagnosis, molecular 
genetics, differential diagnosis, and treatment of patients with MLIV. An 
enhanced awareness of the manifestations of this disorder may help to elucidate 
the true frequency and range of symptoms associated with MLIV, providing insight 
into the pathogenesis of this multi-system disease.

A novel mutation in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase gamma subunit 
(GNPTAG) in two siblings with mucolipidosis type III alters a used glycosylation

The N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase (termed phosphotransferase) 
catalyzes the initial step in the formation of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) 
residues required for the efficient transport of soluble lysosomal enzymes. The 
phosphotransferase is a multisubunit enzyme composed of three subunits 
(alpha2beta2gamma2) that are products of two genes. The gene encoding the 
gamma-subunit (GNPTAG) appears to be defective in patients with mucolipidosis 
type III (ML III). We have analyzed the GNPTAG gene in two siblings with ML III 
showing elevated activities of several lysosomal enzymes in cultured fibroblasts 
serum and diminished activities in cultured fibroblasts. Immunoprecipitation of 
metabolically labeled cathepsin D (CtsD) from fibroblasts revealed that the 
sorting/transport of this lysosomal protease was affected. Addition of ammonium 
chloride inhibiting pH-dependent processes, such as the CtsD-M6P receptor 
interaction, indicated that 15 to 20% of the newly synthesized CtsD is 
transported in ML III fibroblasts in an M6P-dependent manner. By direct 
sequencing a novel homozygous mutation, c.347_349delACA (p.Asn116del), was 
identified affecting a potential N-linked glycosylation site. Western blot 
analysis of extracts from control fibroblasts detect a 97 kDa glycosylated dimer 
whereas ML III cells contain a GNPTAG dimer of reduced molecular mass. These 
data suggest that the loss of the used glycosylation site in the gamma subunit 
may affect the intracellular localization of GNPTAG and the overall efficiency 
of M6P formation.

All over the causes of intractable diarrhea of infancy, microvillous inclusion 
disease is a rare congenital defect of intestinal brush border of unknown 
aetiology. An autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested by cases occurring in 
siblings and high incidence of consanguinity. The prognosis of the disease is 
extremely poor, as life can be sustained only by total parenteral nutrition. The 
authors report a preterm male newborn of 35 weeks gestation presenting severe 
hypernatremic dehydration on day 4 after birth caused by a secretory profuse 
diarrhea and discuss the tools allowing the light microscopic and genetic 
diagnosis. The final diagnosis of microvillus intestinal disease (MVID) was made 
on the third month after extensive investigations using electron microscopic 
examination of intestinal biopsy and genetic confirmation, finding a mutation at 
the homozygous status of MYO5B gene. The infant died on the fourth month in 
spite of optimal electrolytic support and parenteral prolonged nutrition. 
Although MVID is extremely rare, it remains a possible cause of intractable 
secretory diarrhea leading to severe hypernatremic dehydration and metabolic 
acidosis in neonates.

Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is a rare, neurogenetic disorder characterized by 
developmental abnormalities of the brain, and impaired neurological, 
ophthalmological, and gastric function. Considered a lysosomal disease, MLIV is 
characterized by the accumulation of large vacuoles in various cell types. 
Recent evidence indicates that MLIV is caused by mutations in MCOLN1, the gene 
that encodes mucolipin-1 (ML1), a 65-kDa protein showing sequence homology and 
topological similarities with polycystin-2 and other transient receptor 
potential (TRP) channels. In this report, our observations on the channel 
properties of ML1, and molecular pathophysiology of MLIV are reviewed and 
expanded. Our studies have shown that ML1 is a multiple sub-conductance, 
non-selective cation channel. MLIV-causing mutations result in functional 
differences in the channel protein. In particular, the V446L and DeltaF408 
mutations retain channel function but have interesting functional differences 
with regards to pH dependence and Ca(2+) transport. While the wild-type protein 
is inhibited by Ca(2+) transport, mutant ML1 is not. Atomic force microscopy 
imaging of ML1 channels shows that changes in pH modify the aggregation and size 
of the ML1 channels, which has an impact on vesicular fusogenesis. The new 
evidence provides support for a novel role of ML1 cation channels in vesicular 
acidification and normal endosomal function.

PURPOSE: Pathogenic variants in GNPTAB and GNPTG, encoding different subunits of 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, cause mucolipidosis (ML) II, MLIII alpha/beta, and 
MLIII gamma. This study aimed to investigate the cellular and molecular bases 
underlying skeletal abnormalities in patients with MLII and MLIII.
METHODS: We analyzed bone biopsies from patients with MLIII alpha/beta or MLIII 
gamma by undecalcified histology and histomorphometry. The skeletal status of 
Gnptgko and Gnptab-deficient mice was determined and complemented by biochemical 
analysis of primary Gnptgko bone cells. The clinical relevance of the mouse data 
was underscored by systematic urinary collagen crosslinks quantification in 
patients with MLII, MLIII alpha/beta, and MLIII gamma.
RESULTS: The analysis of iliac crest biopsies revealed that bone remodeling is 
impaired in patients with GNPTAB-associated MLIII alpha/beta but not with 
GNPTG-associated MLIII gamma. Opposed to Gnptab-deficient mice, skeletal 
remodeling is not affected in Gnptgko mice. Most importantly, patients with 
variants in GNPTAB but not in GNPTG exhibited increased bone resorption.
CONCLUSION: The gene-specific impact on bone remodeling in human individuals and 
in mice proposes distinct molecular functions of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase 
subunits in bone cells. We therefore appeal for the necessity to classify MLIII 
based on genetic in addition to clinical criteria to ensure appropriate therapy.

Mucolipidosis Type IV (MLIV) is a lysosomal storage disorder that is 
characterized by severe neurologic and ophthalmologic abnormalities. It is a 
progressive disease that usually presents during the first year of life with 
mental retardation, corneal opacities, and delayed motor milestones. First 
described in 1974, MLIV is a rare autosomal recessive disease and the majority 
of patients diagnosed to date are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. MLIV was 
originally classified as a lysosomal storage disorder due to the abnormal 
accumulation of mucopolysaccharides and lipids. Extensive studies in MLIV cells, 
however, have shown that the abnormal storage is due to a defect in the late 
endocytic pathway. Positional cloning led to the recent discovery of a novel 
gene on human chromosome 19, MCOLN1, that is mutated in MLIV. To date 14 
independent mutations have been reported in MCOLN1, with two mutations 
accounting for 95% of the Ashkenazi Jewish MLIV alleles. The identification of 
the MLIV gene has led to a simple tool for definitive diagnosis and will permit 
carrier screening in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. MCOLN1 is a new member of 
the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel gene family. The protein 
encoded by MCOLN1, mucolipin-1, has six predicted transmembrane domains and a 
putative channel pore. The identification of mutations in MCOLN1 represents the 
first example of a neurological disease caused by a TRP-related channel. While 
the function of mucolipin-1 is currently unknown, homology to the TRP 
superfamily and the recent description of the C. elegans mucolipin-1 homolog 
allow us to begin to speculate about the role of mucolipin-1 in diverse cellular 
processes.

Mucolipidosis type IV is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder 
with psychomotor developmental delay, visual impairment, and achlorhydria. A 
mutation in the MCOLN1 gene causes an alteration of the protein mucolipin-1 that 
results in the accumulation of lipids and proteins in cytoplasmic vacuoles 
derived from lysosomes. Visual impairment results mainly from corneal clouding 
and retinal degeneration. The involvement of the corneal epithelium has been 
proposed following clinical observation and confirmed by ultrastructural studies 
of the cornea. We present the case of a child of French Canadian origin affected 
by mucolipidosis type IV who showed abnormal optical coherence tomography 
imaging of the cornea, typical skin cell inclusions on electronic microscopy, 
and a novel pathogenic mutation.

Mucolipidosis II and III are lysosomal storage diseases caused by pathogenetic 
mutations in GNPTAB and GNPTG genes which cause an impaired activity of the 
lysosomal hydrolase N-acetylglucosamine- 1-phosphotransferase, a key enzyme in 
the synthesis of the mannose-6-phosphate targeting signals on lysosomal enzymes. 
Patients with MLII alpha/beta present coarse facial features, cessation of 
statural growth, important skeletal manifestations, impaired neuromotor 
development and cardiorespiratory involvement. All children appear to have 
cardiac involvement, but severe dilated cardiomyopathy is uncommon. In this 
report we describe the case of an 11-month-old girl who is affected by a MLII. 
Analysis of the GNPTAB gene identified at a heterozygous level the previously 
described gene variants c. 2693delA p(Lys898Serfs*13) and c. 2956C>T 
p(Arg986Cys). Her main clinical features were coarse face with gingival 
hypertrophy, dysostosis multiplex, recurrent respiratory infection and an early 
onset of dilated cardiomyopathy, an uncommon feature for MLII. To our knowledge, 
dilated cardiomyopathy has been previously described in literature in only two 
cases of MLII and in one patient affected by MLIII.

Mucolipidosis I--a sialidosis.

Sphranger J, Gehler J, Cantz M.

Mucolipidosis I is characterized by Hurler-like features and skeletal dysplasia 
with a cherry-red macular spot and signs of neurodegeneration involving neuronal 
cells and myelin. Excessive amounts of sialic acid-containing compounds were 
found in cultured fibroblasts, leukocytes, and urine of a patient with a 
clinical phenotype of mucolipidosis I. In cultured fibroblasts, profoundly 
diminished activity of an alpha-N-acetylneuraminidase (sialidase) was found. 
Mucolipidosis I thus appears to be a distinct disorder of complex carbohydrate 
catabolism caused by the genetic deficiency of a neuraminidase.

The High Association of Ophthalmic Manifestations in Individuals With 
Mucolipidosis Type IV.

Gibson D, Brar V, Li R, Kalra A, Goodwin A, Couser N.

PURPOSE: To present a case report of mucolipidosis type IV (ML4) and review the 
literature for all of the ophthalmic abnormalities associated with this disease.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature using PubMed/Medline was 
conducted, and with the addition of the current case report, the eye and ocular 
adnexa findings of 93 patients with ML4 are summarized.
RESULTS: The most common ophthalmic findings reported among the 93 patients 
included corneal clouding (90.3%), strabismus (58.1%), optic nerve pallor 
(52.2%), retinal dystrophy/pigmentary changes (50.5%), and retinal vascular 
attenuation (38.9%). Other less commonly reported findings included nystagmus, 
photophobia, ocular pain, excessive lacrimation, ptosis, and cataracts.
CONCLUSIONS: The ophthalmic findings discussed in the current case report and 
literature review serve as indicators for ML4. Early diagnosis of ML4 is 
important in forming a multidisciplinary management plan, genetic counseling 
strategy, and maximizing the visual development of affected individuals. [J 
Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabimus. 2022;59(5):332-337.].

Mucolipidoses II and III variants with normal N-acetylglucosamine 
1-phosphotransferase activity toward alpha-methylmannoside are due to nonallelic 
mutations.

Normal N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase activity toward mono- and 
oligosaccharide acceptor substrates was detected in cultured skin fibroblasts 
from mucolipidoses II and III patients who were designated as variants (one of 
four mucolipidosis II and three out of six mucolipidosis III patients examined). 
The activity toward natural lysosomal protein acceptors was absent or deficient 
in cell preparations from all patients with classical as well as variant forms 
of mucolipidoses II and III. Complementation analysis, using fused and 
cocultivated mutant fibroblast combinations, revealed that, while cell lines 
with variant mucolipidosis III constituted a complementation group distinct from 
that of classical forms of mucolipidoses II and III, the variant mucolipidosis 
II cell line belonged to the same complementation group as did the classical 
forms. In contrast to the mutant enzyme from variant mucolipidosis III patients 
that failed to recognize lysosomal proteins as the specific acceptor substrates, 
the activity toward alpha-methylmannoside in the variant mucolipidosis II 
patient could be inhibited by exogenous lysosomal enzyme preparations (bovine 
beta-glucuronidase and human hexosaminidase A). These findings suggest that 
N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase is composed of at least two distinct 
polypeptides: (1) a recognition subunit that is defective in the mucolipidosis 
III variants and (2) a catalytic subunit that is deficient or altered in the 
classical forms of mucolipidoses II and III as well as in the mucolipidosis II 
variant.

Mucolipidosis Type II Affecting 1 Fetus and Placental Disk of a 
Dichorionic-Diamnionic Twin Gestation: A Case Report and Review of the 
Literature.

Mucolipidosis type II, also known as I-cell disease, is an autosomal recessive 
inborn error of metabolism, resulting from loss-of-function mutations in GNPTAB. 
Affected infants exhibit multiple physical anomalies and developmental delay, 
and death from disease follows in early childhood. Here we present an 
instructive case of mucolipidosis type II affecting 1 fetus and placental disk 
in a dichorionic-diamnionic twin pregnancy delivered at 36-wk gestation. The 
second twin and placental disk showed no abnormality. On microscopic 
examination, the affected placenta displayed marked vacuolization of the 
syncytiotrophoblast and Hofbauer cells, which was confirmed on ultrastructural 
examination. To our knowledge, this is the first description of placental 
findings in a twin pregnancy, wherein only 1 twin is affected by an inborn error 
of metabolism. This provides an opportunity to highlight the placental 
abnormalities seen in this group of diseases, and to emphasize the role of 
pathologic examination in early detection of otherwise unsuspected inborn errors 
of metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Sialidosis type 1 is a rare inherited disorder with a high 
disability. No genetically confirmed mainland Chinese patient with sialidosis 
type 1 has been reported. This study evaluated the phenotypes and genotypes of 
mainland Chinese patients with sialidosis type 1.
METHODS: It was a retrospective case series study. Four unrelated patients were 
enrolled. Comprehensive clinical evaluations and molecular genetic analysis of 
the NEU1 gene were performed.
RESULTS: Three out of four patients presented progressive myoclonus epilepsy. 
The best-corrected visual acuity ranged from 20/2000 to 20/25. Punctate 
cataracts were found in all of the patients. Distinct macular cherry red spots 
were observed in three patients by fundoscopy, and a relatively normal fundus 
was revealed in one patient. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed increased 
reflectivity of the nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers, and fundus 
autofluorescence (FAF) revealed hyperautofluorescent areas surrounding the fovea 
in all of the patients. Only superficial retinal vessels can be observed using 
OCT angiography; the deeper capillary plexus could not be observed. Visual 
evoked potential revealed varying degrees of decreased amplitude and/or 
prolonged latency of P100 or P2 waves. The most frequent sequence variant 
identified was c.544A>G (p.S182G) (NM_000434.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study first described the ophthalmic and neurologic 
characteristics of a small cohort of unrelated mainland Chinese patients with 
sialidosis type 1. We found that c.544A>G (p. S182G) might be a hotspot variant 
in Chinese patients. The accumulation of metabolic products in the nerve fiber 
and ganglion cell layers is a characteristic ocular finding that could be 
sensitively detected by OCT and FAF imaging.

Sialidosis, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by a deficiency of 
NEU1 encoded enzyme alpha-N-acetyl neuraminidase. We report a premature male 
with neonatal-onset type II sialidosis which was associated with left 
ventricular dysfunction. The clinical presentation and subsequent progression 
which culminated in his untimely death at 16 months of age are succinctly 
described. Early-onset cardiovascular involvement as noted in this patient is 
not well characterised. The case report is supplemented by a comprehensive 
review of the determinants, characteristics, and the clinical course of 
cardiovascular involvement in this rare condition.

Mucolipidosis IV (MLIV) is an autosomal-recessive disease caused by 
loss-of-function mutations in the MCOLN1 gene encoding the non-selective 
cationic lysosomal channel transient receptor potential mucolipin-1 (TRPML1). 
Patients with MLIV suffer from severe motor and cognitive deficits that manifest 
in early infancy and progressive loss of vision leading to blindness in the 
second decade of life. There are no therapies available for MLIV and the unmet 
medical need is extremely high. Here we review the spectrum of clinical 
presentations and the latest research in the MLIV pre-clinical model, with the 
aim of highlighting the progress in understanding the pathophysiology of the 
disease. These highlights include elucidation of the neurodevelopmental versus 
neurodegenerative features over the course of disease, hypomyelination as one of 
the major brain pathological disease hallmarks, and dysregulation of cytokines, 
with emerging evidence of IFN-gamma pathway upregulation in response to TRPML1 
loss and pro-inflammatory activation of astrocytes and microglia. These 
scientific advances in the MLIV field provide a basis for future translational 
research, including biomarker and therapy development, that are desperately 
needed for this patient population.

A GNPTAB nonsense variant is associated with feline mucolipidosis II (I-cell 
disease).

BACKGROUND: Mucolipidosis II (ML II; I-cell disease) is caused by a deficiency 
of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GNPTAB; EC 2.7.8.17), which leads 
to a failure to internalize acid hydrolases into lysosomes for proper catabolism 
of various substances. This is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease 
and causes severe progressive neuropathy and oculoskeletal dysfunction in humans 
(OMIM 252500). A naturally occurring disease model has been reported in juvenile 
domestic cats (OMIA 001248-9685) with clinical signs similar to human patients. 
We investigated the molecular genetic basis of ML II in a colony of affected 
cats by sequencing the coding and regulatory regions of GNPTAB from affected and 
clinically healthy related and unrelated domestic cats and compared the 
sequences to the published feline genome sequence (NCBI-RefSeq accession no. 
XM_003989173.4, Gene ID: 101100231).
RESULTS: All affected cats were homozygous for a single base substitution 
(c.2644C > T) in exon 13 of GNPTAB. This variant results in a premature stop 
codon (p.Gln882*) which predicts severe truncation and complete dysfunction of 
the GNPTAB enzyme. About 140 GNPTAB variants have been described in human ML II 
patients, with 41.3% nonsense/missense mutations, nine occurring in the same 
gene region as in this feline model. Restriction fragment length polymorphism 
and allelic discrimination real-time polymerase chain reaction assays accurately 
differentiated between clear, asymptomatic carriers and homozygous affected 
cats.
CONCLUSION: Molecular genetic characterization advances this large animal model 
of ML II for use to further define the pathophysiology of the disease and 
evaluate novel therapeutic approaches for this fatal lysosomal storage disease 
in humans.

I-cell disease (ML II) and pseudo-Hurler poly-dystrophy (ML-III) are lysosomal 
storage diseases caused by abnormal lysosomal enzyme phosphorylation and 
localization. In both diseases, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are secreted 
into the extra-cellular medium instead of being targeted correctly to lysosomes. 
All cells and tissues of affected medium instead of being targeted correctly to 
lysosomes. All cells and tissues of affected patients are deficient in 
UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: lysosomal enzyme 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase activity. However, we have demonstrated 
that liver cells from ML II patients have normal lysosomal enzyme contents. In 
Japan, ML II is a relatively common disorder whereas ML III is very rare as 
compared to Western Countries. The natural history of 21 cases with ML II, as 
well as 5 prenatally diagnosed cases of ML II, have been reported by our 
research group.

A role for inherited metabolic deficits in persistent developmental stuttering.

Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

Stuttering is a common but poorly understood speech disorder. Consistent 
evidence for the involvement of genetic factors in stuttering has motivated 
studies aimed at identifying causative genetic variants that could shed light on 
the underlying molecular and cellular deficits in this disorder. Such studies 
have begun to identify causative genes. The purpose of this review is to 
summarize the gene discoveries to date, and to cover the subsequent functional 
studies that are beginning to provide insights into how these gene mutations 
might cause stuttering. Surprisingly, the first variant genes to be associated 
with stuttering are those encoding the lysosomal targeting system, GNPTAB, 
GNPTG, and NAGPA. Although mutations in NAGPA have not been associated with a 
disorder in humans, mutations in GNPTAB and GNPTG cause mucolipidosis types II 
and III, which are rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders, 
associated with pathology of bone, connective tissue, liver, spleen, and brain. 
Analysis of mutations in these genes has so far identified predominantly 
missense mutations in stuttering, in contrast to the truncating and other 
mutations that result in very low GNPTAB/G enzyme activity and are historically 
associated with mucolipidosis. Genetic evidence for the role of lysosomal 
targeting mutations in stuttering has now been buttressed by biochemical studies 
of the mutant enzymes found in this disorder. While data on the 
GlcNAc-phosphotransferase encoded by GNPTAB/G remains limited and only 
suggestive, a study of the enzyme encoded by NAGPA has shown that the mutations 
found in stuttering reduce the overall cellular activity of this enzyme by about 
half, and that they result in deficits in intracellular processing and 
trafficking that lead to a reduced cellular half life. How these deficits result 
in the presumed speech-specific neuropathology associated with stuttering is not 
yet known. However these findings have opened several new lines of inquiry, 
including studies in mice carrying human stuttering mutations, that represent 
promising approaches to this disorder.

Lysosomal sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18) has a dual physiological function; it 
participates in intralysosomal catabolism of sialylated glycoconjugates and is 
involved in cellular immune response. Mutations in the sialidase gene NEU1, 
located on chromosome 6p21.3, result in autosomal recessive disorder, 
sialidosis, which is characterized by the progressive lysosomal storage of 
sialylated glycopeptides and oligosaccharides. Sialidosis type I is a milder, 
late-onset, normosomatic form of the disorder. Type I patients develop visual 
defects, myoclonus syndrome, cherry-red macular spots, ataxia, hyperreflexia, 
and seizures. The severe early-onset form, sialidosis type II, is also 
associated with dysostosis multiplex, Hurler-like phenotype, mental retardation, 
and hepatosplenomegaly. We summarize information on the 34 unique mutations 
determined so far in the sialidase gene, including four novel missense and one 
novel nonsense mutations found in two Czech and two French sialidosis patients. 
The analysis of sialidase mutations in sialidosis revealed considerable 
molecular heterogeneity, reflecting the diversity of clinical phenotypes that 
make molecular diagnosis difficult. The majority of sialidosis patients have had 
missense mutations, many of which have been expressed; their effects on 
activity, stability, intracellular localization, and supramolecular organization 
of sialidase were studied. A structural model of sialidase allowed us to 
localize mutations in the sialidase molecule and to predict their impact on the 
tertiary structure and biochemical properties of the enzyme.

Protective protein/cathepsin A rescues N-glycosylation defects in 
neuraminidase-1.

Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.

BACKGROUND: Neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) catabolizes the hydrolysis of sialic acids 
from sialo-glycoconjugates. NEU1 depends on its interaction with the protective 
protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) for lysosomal compartmentalization and catalytic 
activation. Murine NEU1 contains 4 N-glycosylation sites, 3 of which are 
conserved in the human enzyme. The expression of NEU1 gives rise to 
differentially glycosylated proteins.
METHODS: We generated single-point mutations in mouse NEU1 at each of the 4 
N-glycosylation sites. Mutant enzymes were expressed in NEU1-deficient cells in 
the presence and absence of PPCA.
RESULTS: All 4 N-glycosylation variants were targeted to the lysosomal/endosomal 
compartment. All N-glycans, with the exception of the most C-terminal glycan, 
were important for maintaining stability or catalytic activity. The loss of 
catalytic activity caused by the deletion of the second N-glycan was rescued by 
increasing PPCA expression. Similar results were obtained with a human NEU1 
N-glycosylation mutant identified in a sialidosis patient. The N-terminal 
N-glycan of NEU1 is indispensable for its function, whereas the C-terminal 
N-glycan appears to be non-essential. The omission of the second N-glycan can be 
compensated for by upregulating the expression of PPCA.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These findings could be relevant for the design of target 
therapies for patients carrying specific NEU1 mutations.

Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.

Objective: To investigate the clinical and genetic characteristics of 3 patients 
with mucolipidosis and to perform literature review. Methods: A retrospective 
analysis was made on the clinical data and genetic test results of 3 pedigrees 
with mucolipidosis. The patients were followed up at the Genetic and Prenatal 
Diagnosis Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from 
February 2016 to August 2018. A neonatal inherited metabolic diseases gene panel 
including GNPTAB, GNPTG, MCOLN1, etc. was used for next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) based testing. Sanger sequencing was subsequently used to confirm the 
suspected pathological variants in the patients and their family members. 
Original papers on mucolipidosis published up to December 2018 were retrieved 
from PubMed, CNKI and WanFang databases by using the key words "mucolipidosis" 
AND "Chinese" . Results: The onset ages ranged from (9-90) days. The common 
clinical characteristics of the 3 patients are developmental delay and skeletal 
abnormalities. Targeted NGS revealed 5 different variations all in GNPTAB 
including p.Arg364Ter, p.Ser385Leu, p.Try404Ter, p. Arg587Ter, c.1284+1G>T. Two 
variants p.Ser385Leu and c.1284+1G>T were novel. Twenty-six cases of 
mucolipidosis have been reported in Chinese from 8 papers, which included 11 
type ML Ⅱα/β, 11 type ML Ⅲ α/β and 4 type ML Ⅲ γ. c.2715+1G>A and p.Arg364Ter 
variants are likely the hot variants in Chinese ML patients. Conclusions: 
Mucolipidosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
developmental delay and skeletal abnormalities. NGS plus Sanger sequencing 
detection is effective and accurate for making genetic diagnosis. p.Ser385Leu 
and c.1284+1G>T of GNPTAB gene are identified as novel pathogenic variants. 
GNPTAB gene is the main disease causing gene among Chinese ML patients, and 
c.2715+1G>A and p.Arg364Ter are the most common variants.

Mutations in the GNPTAB and GNPTG genes cause mucolipidosis (ML) type II, type 
III alpha/beta, and type III gamma, which are autosomal recessively inherited 
lysosomal storage disorders. GNPTAB and GNPTG encode the α/β-precursor and the 
γ-subunit of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-1-phosphotransferase, respectively, 
the key enzyme for the generation of mannose 6-phosphate targeting signals on 
lysosomal enzymes. Defective GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase results in missorting 
of lysosomal enzymes and accumulation of non-degradable macromolecules in 
lysosomes, strongly impairing cellular function. MLII-affected patients have 
coarse facial features, cessation of statural growth and neuromotor development, 
severe skeletal abnormalities, organomegaly, and cardiorespiratory insufficiency 
leading to death in early childhood. MLIII alpha/beta and MLIII gamma are 
attenuated forms of the disease. Since the identification of the GNPTAB and 
GNPTG genes, 564 individuals affected by MLII or MLIII have been described in 
the literature. In this report, we provide an overview on 258 and 50 mutations 
in GNPTAB and GNPTG, respectively, including 58 novel GNPTAB and seven novel 
GNPTG variants. Comprehensive functional studies of GNPTAB missense mutations 
did not only gain insights into the composition and function of the 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, but also helped to define genotype-phenotype 
correlations to predict the clinical outcome in patients.

Trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES) is a very rare autosomal recessive genetic 
disorder, which is characterized by intractable diarrhea during infancy, 
dysmorphic features, immunodeficiency, and a failure to thrive. There are still 
significant difficulties for patients and clinicians in terms of the management 
of THES, even though its molecular basis has been uncovered in the last decade. 
In this article, we have presented two cases relating to siblings that have been 
diagnosed with the condition. Concerning one of the patients, we described a 
novel variation (c.2114 + 5G > A) in the TTC37 gene and a mild clinical course; 
meanwhile, the other one was clinically diagnosed with THES at 17 years of age, 
but they had seizures and died suddenly. These cases expand the spectrum of 
clinical findings in relation to THES.

Mucolipidosis type IV and the mucolipins.

MLIV (mucolipidosis type IV) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder 
caused by mutations in MCOLN1, a gene that encodes TRPML1 (mucolipin-1), a 
member of the TRPML (transient receptor potential mucolipin) cation channels. 
Two additional homologues are TRPML2 and TRPML3 comprising the TRPML subgroup in 
the TRP superfamily. The three proteins play apparently key roles along the 
endocytosis process, and thus their cellular localization varies among the 
different group members. Thus TRPML1 is localized exclusively to late endosomes 
and lysosomes, TRPML2 is primarily located in the recycling clathrin-independent 
GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchored proteins and early endosomes, and 
TRPML3 is primarily located in early endosomes. Apparently, all three proteins' 
main physiological function underlies Ca(2+) channelling, regulating the 
endocytosis process. Recent findings also indicate that the three TRPML proteins 
form heteromeric complexes at least in some of their cellular content. The 
physiological role of these complexes in lysosomal function remains to be 
elucidated, as well as their effect on the pathophysiology of MLIV. Another open 
question is whether any one of the TRPMLs bears additional function in channel 
activity.

Mutations in the galactosidase β 1 (GLB1) gene cause lysosomal β-galactosidase 
(β-Gal) deficiency and clinical onset of the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage 
disease, GM1 gangliosidosis. β-Gal and neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) form a multienzyme 
complex in lysosomes along with the molecular chaperone, protective protein 
cathepsin A (PPCA). NEU1 is deficient in the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage 
disease sialidosis, and its targeting to and stability in lysosomes strictly 
depend on PPCA. In contrast, β-Gal only partially depends on PPCA, prompting us 
to investigate the role that β-Gal plays in the multienzyme complex. Here, we 
demonstrate that β-Gal negatively regulates NEU1 levels in lysosomes by 
competitively displacing this labile sialidase from PPCA. Chronic cellular 
uptake of purified recombinant human β-Gal (rhβ-Gal) or chronic 
lentiviral-mediated GLB1 overexpression in GM1 gangliosidosis patient 
fibroblasts coincides with profound secondary NEU1 deficiency. A regimen of 
intermittent enzyme replacement therapy dosing with rhβ-Gal, followed by enzyme 
withdrawal, is sufficient to augment β-Gal activity levels in GM1 gangliosidosis 
patient fibroblasts without promoting NEU1 deficiency. In the absence of β-Gal, 
NEU1 levels are elevated in the GM1 gangliosidosis mouse brain, which are 
restored to normal levels following weekly intracerebroventricular dosing with 
rhβ-Gal. Collectively, our results highlight the need to carefully titrate the 
dose and dosing frequency of β-Gal augmentation therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis. 
They further suggest that intermittent intracerebroventricular enzyme 
replacement therapy dosing with rhβ-Gal is a tunable approach that can safely 
augment β-Gal levels while maintaining NEU1 at physiological levels in the GM1 
gangliosidosis brain.

Mucolipidosis (ML) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder with a wide spectrum of 
disease severity according to the type. Sleep-disordered breathing is recognized 
as a characteristic feature of ML but objective data are scarce. The aim of the 
study was to describe sleep data and medical management in children with ML α/β. 
All patients with ML α/β followed at a national reference center of ML were 
included. Five patients had ML II, one patient had ML III and one patient had ML 
II-III. One patient was started on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to allow 
extubation after prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation. The six other 
patients underwent sleep study at a median age of 1.8 years (range 4 months-17.4 
years). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was observed in all patients with a median 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 36 events/hr (range 5-52) requiring continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) or NIV. CPAP/NIV resulted in an improvement of 
nocturnal gas exchange and was continued in all patients with an excellent 
compliance. Two patients died. Systematic sleep studies are recommended at time 
of diagnosis in ML. CPAP or NIV are effective treatments of OSA, well tolerated, 
and may contribute to improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers.

Mucolipidosis I.

Cibis GW, Harris DJ, Chapman AL, Tripathi RC.

A case of mucolipidosis I had clinical and histopathologic features that were a 
combination of changes found in both mucopolysaccharidoses and sphingolipidoses. 
Corneal clouding, spokelike cataracts, tortuous conjunctival and retinal 
vessels, and strabismus were clinical findings. Histopathologically, there were 
inclusion vacuoles similar to those seen in mucopolysaccharidoses; lamellar 
bodies typical of sphingolipidoses were rare. These vacuoles were seen in 
conjunctival and corneal epithelium and fibrocytes, conjunctival and retinal 
vessel endothelium, and all retinal cell layers.

Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of rare inherited metabolic 
diseases caused by the malfunction of the lysosomal system, which results in the 
accumulation of undergraded substrates inside the lysosomes and leads to severe 
and progressive pathology. Despite there currently being a broad understanding 
of the molecular defects behind LSDs, curative therapies have been approved for 
only few of these diseases, whereas existing treatments are still mostly 
symptomatic with several limitations. Mucolipidosis type II alpha/beta (ML II) 
is one of most severe LSDs, which is caused by the total deficiency of the 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, a key enzyme for the formation of specific 
targeting signals on lysosomal hydrolases to lysosomes. 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase is a multimeric enzyme complex encoded by two genes: 
GNPTAB and GNPTG. One of the most frequent ML II causal mutation is a 
dinucleotide deletion on exon 19 of GNPTAB (c.3503_3504del) that leads to the 
generation of a truncated protein, loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity, 
and missorting of multiple lysosomal enzymes. Presently, there is no therapy 
available for ML II. In this study, we explored the possibility of an innovative 
therapeutic strategy for ML II based on the use of antisense oligonucleotides 
(AOs) capable to induce the skipping of GNPTAB exon 19 harboring the most common 
disease-causing mutation, c.3503_3504del. The approach confirmed the ability of 
specific AOs for RNA splicing modulation, thus paving the way for future studies 
on the therapeutic potential of this strategy.

We describe a patient with failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, 
and elevation of multiple plasma lysosomal enzyme activities mimicking 
mucolipidosis II or III, in whom a diagnosis of hereditary fructose intolerance 
(HFI) was ultimately obtained. She presented before introduction of solid foods, 
given her consumption of a fructose-containing infant formula. We present the 
most extensive panel of lysosomal enzyme activities reported to date in a 
patient with HFI, and propose that multiple enzyme elevations in plasma, 
especially when in conjunction with a normal plasma α-mannosidase activity, 
should elicit a differential diagnosis of HFI. We also performed a review of the 
literature on the different etiologies of elevated lysosomal enzyme activities 
in serum or plasma. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Mucolipidosis type III α/β or γ (MLIII) are rare autosomal recessive 
diseases, in which reduced activity of the enzyme UDP-N-acetyl 
glucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-PTase) leads to intra-lysosomal 
accumulation of different substrates. Publications on the natural history of 
MLIII, especially the milder forms, are scarce. This study provides a detailed 
description of the disease characteristics and its natural course in adult 
patients with MLIII.
METHODS: In this retrospective chart study, the clinical, biochemical and 
molecular findings in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MLIII from 
three treatment centres were collected.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients with MLIII were included in this study. Four patients 
(31%) were initially misdiagnosed with a type of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). 
Four patients (31%) had mild cognitive impairment. Six patients (46%) needed 
help with activities of daily living (ADL) or were wheelchair-dependent. All 
patients had dysostosis multiplex and progressive secondary osteoarthritis, 
characterised by cartilage destruction and bone lesions in multiple joints. All 
patients underwent multiple orthopaedic surgical interventions as early as the 
second or third decades of life, of which total hip replacement (THR) was the 
most common procedure (61% of patients). Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) was found 
in 12 patients (92%) and in eight patients (61%), CTS release was performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe skeletal abnormalities, resulting from abnormal bone 
development and severe progressive osteoarthritis, are the hallmark of MLIII, 
necessitating surgical orthopaedic interventions early in life. Future therapies 
for this disease should focus on improving cartilage and bone quality, 
preventing skeletal complications and improving mobility.

I-cell disease.

Patel ZM, Ambani LM.

A 6-month-old female infant presented with severe psychomotor retardation, 
coarse facies, gingival hyperplasia, thick skin, restricted joint movements and 
radiological features suggestive of the Hurler syndrome. Her urine showed no 
excess excretion of mucopolysaccharides. I-cell disease was suspected from the 
onset of clinical features in early infancy, the subsequent progress and the 
absence of mucopolysacchariduria. Marked elevation of the activity in serum of 
three lysosomal enzymes confirmed the diagnosis. This patient had repeated 
convulsions, a feature not previously reported in this condition. This is the 
first case report of I-cell disease from India.

BACKGROUND: Mucolipidosis IV (MLIV) is an autosomal recessive pediatric disease 
that leads to motor and cognitive deficits and loss of vision. It is caused by a 
loss of function of the lysosomal channel transient receptor potential 
mucolipin-1 and is associated with an early pro-inflammatory brain phenotype, 
including increased cytokine expression. The goal of the current study was to 
determine whether blood cytokines are linked to motor dysfunction in patients 
with MLIV and reflect brain inflammatory changes observed in an MLIV mouse 
model.
METHODS: To determine the relationship between blood cytokines and motor 
function, we collected plasma from MLIV patients and parental controls 
concomitantly with assessment of motor function using the Brief Assessment of 
Motor Function and Modified Ashworth scales. We then compared these profiles 
with cytokine profiles in brain and plasma samples collected from the Mcoln1-/- 
mouse model of MLIV.
RESULTS: We found that MLIV patients had prominently increased cytokine levels 
compared to familial controls and identified profiles of cytokines correlated 
with motor dysfunction, including IFN-γ, IFN-α2, and IP-10. We found that IP-10 
was a key differentiating factor separating MLIV cases from controls based on 
data from human plasma, mouse plasma, and mouse brain.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that MLIV is characterized by increased blood 
cytokines, which are strongly related to underlying neurological and functional 
deficits in MLIV patients. Moreover, our data identify the interferon 
pro-inflammatory axis in both human and mouse signatures, suggesting that 
interferon signaling is an important aspect of MLIV pathology.

Mutations in the myosin 5β, syntaxin-binding protein 2, and syntaxin 3 genes 
lead to microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), an autosomal recessive congenital 
enteropathy. This rare disease is characterized by lack of microvilli on the 
surface of enterocytes in the small intestine, the presence of pathognomonic 
intracellular microvillus inclusions, and vesicular bodies within these 
enterocytes. This pathology leads to the characteristic intractable, 
life-threatening, watery diarrhea. In the more common early-onset form, affected 
patients present in the first few days after birth, whereas in the late-onset 
form, clinical manifestations appear at approximately 2 to 3 months of age. 
Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis, but the infant's medical history, 
clinical presentation, and small intestinal biopsy results are strongly 
suggestive of the diagnosis. The prevalence of MVID is thought to be higher in 
countries with a high degree of consanguinity. Patients with MVID cannot 
tolerate feedings and require continuous total parenteral nutrition. Mortality 
is extremely high in the early-onset type with reports of survival in patients 
treated with small intestinal transplantation. Medical counseling for parents of 
infants with MVID needs to reflect our current understanding of the various 
genetic forms of this disease, the feasible management, and anticipated 
outcomes.

Loss of the human mucolipin-1 gene underlies mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), a 
lysosomal storage disease that results in severe developmental neuropathology. 
Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases, MLIV is not associated with a lack of 
lysosomal hydrolases; instead, MLIV cells display abnormal endocytosis of lipids 
and accumulate large vesicles, indicating that a defect in endocytosis may 
underlie the disease. Here we report the identification of a loss-of-function 
mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans mucolipin-1 homolog, cup-5, and show that 
this mutation results in an enhanced rate of uptake of fluid-phase markers, 
decreased degradation of endocytosed protein and accumulation of large vacuoles. 
Overexpression of cup-5(+) causes the opposite phenotype, indicating that cup-5 
activity controls aspects of endocytosis. Studies in model organisms such as C. 
elegans have helped illuminate fundamental mechanisms involved in normal 
cellular function and human disease; thus the C. elegans cup-5 mutant may be a 
useful model for studying conserved aspects of mucolipin-1 structure and 
function and for assessing the effects of potential therapeutic compounds.

Targeting of soluble lysosomal enzymes requires mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) 
signals whose formation is initiated by the hexameric N-acetylglucosamine 
(GlcNAc)-1-phosphotransferase complex (α2β2γ2). Upon proteolytic cleavage by 
site-1 protease, the α/β-subunit precursor is catalytically activated but the 
functions of γ-subunits (Gnptg) in M6P modification of lysosomal enzymes are 
unknown. To investigate this, we analyzed the Gnptg expression in mouse tissues, 
primary cultured cells, and in Gnptg reporter mice in vivo, and found high 
amounts in the brain, eye, kidney, femur, vertebra and fibroblasts. 
Consecutively we performed comprehensive quantitative lysosomal proteome and M6P 
secretome analysis in fibroblasts of wild-type and Gnptgko mice mimicking the 
lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis III. Although the cleavage of the 
α/β-precursor was not affected by Gnptg deficiency, the 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity was significantly reduced. We purified 
lysosomes and identified 29 soluble lysosomal proteins by SILAC-based mass 
spectrometry exhibiting differential abundance in Gnptgko fibroblasts which was 
confirmed by Western blotting and enzymatic activity analysis for selected 
proteins. A subset of these lysosomal enzymes show also reduced M6P 
modifications, fail to reach lysosomes and are secreted, among them 
α-l-fucosidase and arylsulfatase B. Low levels of these enzymes correlate with 
the accumulation of non-degraded fucose-containing glycostructures and sulfated 
glycosaminoglycans in Gnptgko lysosomes. Incubation of Gnptgko fibroblasts with 
arylsulfatase B partially rescued glycosaminoglycan storage. Combinatorial 
treatments with other here identified missorted enzymes of this degradation 
pathway might further correct glycosaminoglycan accumulation and will provide a 
useful basis to reveal mechanisms of selective, Gnptg-dependent formation of M6P 
residues on lysosomal proteins.

Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are rare to extremely rare monogenic 
disorders. Their incidence, however, has probably been underestimated owing to 
their complex clinical manifestations. Sialidosis is a prototypical LSD 
inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and caused by mutations in the NEU1 
gene that result in a deficiency of alpha-N-acetyl neuraminidase 1 (NEU1). Two 
basic forms of this disease, type I and type II, are known. The dysmorphic type 
II form features LSD symptoms including congenital hydrops, dysmorphogenetic 
traits, hepato-splenomegaly and severe intellectual disability. The diagnosis is 
more challenging in the normosomatic type I forms, whose clinical findings at 
onset include ocular defects, ataxia and generalized myoclonus. Here we report 
the clinical, biochemical and molecular analysis of five patients with 
sialidosis type I. Two patients presented novel NEU1 mutations. One of these 
patients was compound heterozygous for two novel NEU1 missense mutations: 
c.530A>T (p.Asp177Val) and c.1010A>G (p.His337Arg), whereas a second patient was 
compound heterozygous for a known mutation and a novel c.839G>A (p.Arg280Gln) 
mutation. We discuss the impact of these new mutations on the structural 
properties of NEU1. We also review available clinical reports of patients with 
sialidosis type I, with the aim of identifying the most frequent initial 
clinical manifestations and achieving more focused diagnoses.

The cornea in connective tissue diseases.

Maumenee IH.

Even though lenticular and retinal abnormalities seem to dominate the 
ophthalmologic picture in Marfan's syndrome, the cornea shows significant 
abnormalities consisting of a striking flattening and corneal astigmatism. The 
use of conjunctival biopsies followed by histochemical and electron-microscopic 
evaluation shows low morbidity but an excellent yield of diagnostic information 
on storage diseases, and an ectopic collagen may be the basis of at least one 
type of keratoconus. Much more work has to be done on defining the collagens of 
the human eye in embryologic, fetal, and postnatal stages under normal and 
pathologic conditions. The yield of such studies may be high for an 
understanding of such diseases as myopia, retinal detachment, and keratoconus.

Mucolipidosis III gamma (ML III γ) is a slowly progressive disorder that affects 
multiple parts of the body such as the skeleton, joints, and connective tissue 
structures. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the GNPTG gene that provides 
instructions for producing the γ subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. In this 
study we aim to characterize clinical findings and biological insights on two 
novel GNPTG variants causing ML III γ phenotypes with varying severity. We 
report on two siblings with ML III γ bearing the previously undescribed 
c.477C > G (p.Y159*) nonsense variant in a homozygous state as well as a patient 
with ML III γ bearing the novel c.110 + 19_111-17del variant in a homozygous 
state. These variants were revealed by whole-exome sequencing and Sanger 
sequencing, respectively. Their parents, who are heterozygotes for the same 
mutation, are healthy. The clinical and radiographic presentation of ML III γ in 
our patients who had c.477C > G (p.Y159*) variant is consistent with a 
relatively severe form of the disease, which is further supported by a working 
three-dimensional model of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase γ subunit. On the 
other hand, it is seen that our patient who carries the c.110 + 19_111-17del 
variant has a milder phenotype. Our findings help broaden the spectrum of GNPTG 
variants causing ML III γ and offer structural and mechanistic insights into 
loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase γ subunit function.

Mucolipidosis II (ML II) is a fatal lysosomal storage disorder resulting from 
defects in the multimeric GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase responsible for the 
initial step in the generation of the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition 
marker. M6P residues on oligosaccharides of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes 
are essential for efficient receptor-mediated transport to lysosomes. We used 
the recombinant GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase gamma subunit as an affinity matrix 
to purify an unknown protein identified as the product of GNPTA (encoding GNPTA, 
previously known as MGC4170). The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,256 amino acids 
with two putative transmembrane domains and a complex preserved modular 
structure comprising at least six domains. The N-terminal domain of GNPTA, 
interrupted by a long insertion, shows similarities to bacterial capsule 
biosynthesis proteins. We identified seven mutations in GNPTA that lead to 
premature translational termination in six individuals with ML II. Retroviral 
transduction of fibroblasts from an individual with ML II resulted in the 
expression and localization of GNPTA in the Golgi apparatus, accompanied by the 
correction of hypersecretion of lysosomal enzymes. Our results provide evidence 
that GNPTA encodes a subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase defective in 
individuals with ML II.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic cause of a familial form of late-onset action 
myoclonus in 2 unrelated patients. Both probands had 2 siblings displaying a 
similar disorder. Extensive laboratory examinations, including biochemical 
assessment for urine sialic acid in the 2 probands, were negative.
METHODS: Exome sequencing was performed in the probands using an Illumina 
platform. Segregation analysis of putative mutations was performed in all family 
members by standard Sanger sequencing protocols.
RESULTS: NEU1 mutations were detected in 3 siblings of each family with 
prominent cortical myoclonus presenting in the third decade of life and having a 
mild and slowly progressive course. They did not have macular cherry-red spot 
and their urinary sialic acid excretion was within normal values. Genetic 
analysis demonstrated a homozygous mutation in family 1 (c.200G>T, p.S67I) and 2 
compound heterozygous mutations in family 2 (c.679G>A, p.G227R; c.913C>T, 
p.R305C).
CONCLUSIONS: Our observation indicates that sialidosis should be suspected and 
the NEU1 gene analyzed in patients with isolated action myoclonus presenting in 
adulthood in the absence of other typical clinical and laboratory findings.

Mucolipidosis type III (MLIII) (MIM# 252600) is an uncommon autosomal recessive 
disorder that results from uridine 5'-diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine: lysosomal 
hydrolase N-acetyl-1-phosphotransferase or UDP-GlcNAc 1-phosphotransferase 
deficiency. Clinical manifestations include developmental delay, short stature 
and other structural abnormalities. Less common clinical features, such as 
carpal tunnel syndrome, claw hand deformities, trigger fingers, and claw toes 
have previously been reported, but no specific association with tarsal tunnel 
syndrome has been reported in the literature. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is caused 
by entrapment of the posterior tibialis nerve in the tunnel formed by the medial 
malleolus of the ankle and the flexor retinaculum. It causes pain in the heel 
and sole of the foot as well as abnormal sensation in the distribution area of 
nervus tibialis posterior. In adults, the most common cause described is a 
ganglion. The phenomenon is rare in children and the published series are small. 
This case report portrays the presentation of a young girl with breath-holding 
spells secondary to painful bilateral tarsal tunnel syndrome and trigger fingers 
subsequently diagnosed with MLIII.

Sialic acid (SA), a terminal monosaccharide of glycoconjugates, has a central 
role in human biological function. Various point mutations result in the 
malmetabolism of SA and inherited disorders: Defective SA synthesis causes 
sialuria and defective SA catabolism causes sialidosis and sialic acid storage 
disease (SASD). These inborn errors of metabolism are characterised by increased 
urinary free SA. This article reviews biochemical and clinical features that are 
distinct to each disorder. In view of recent evidence indicating a wide 
underestimation in the prevalence of sialic acid disorders, laboratory methods 
for determining urinary free SA and its implications for screening and prenatal 
diagnosis are evaluated.

Sialidosis is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease caused by NEU1 gene 
mutations. A 25-year-old woman developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures since 
teenage, followed by progressive visional decline and limb myoclonus. Her sister 
had similar presentations. Both patients were products of a consanguineous 
marriage. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed extensive paroxysmal spiky beta 
brush. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) after stimulation of median nerves 
demonstrated giant SEP and C-reflex support the cortical origin of myoclonus. 
Genetic tests confirmed that both sisters carried the known pathogenic 
homozygous mutation of c.544A > G in exon 3 of the NEU1 gene. The diagnosis of 
sialidosis type 1 was then made. This suggests that neurophysiological 
abnormalities, especially spiky beta brush on EEG, might facilitate the early 
diagnosis of sialidosis type 1.

Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from 
mutations in the MCOLN1 gene. This gene encodes the endosomal/lysosomal 
transient receptor potential channel protein mucolipin-1 (TRPML1). Affected 
patients suffer from neurodevelopmental abnormalities and progressive retinal 
dystrophy. In a prospective natural history study we hypothesized the presence 
of an additional slow cerebral neurodegenerative process. We have recruited 5 
patients, tested their neurodevelopmental status, and measured cerebral regional 
volumes and white matter integrity using MRI yearly. Over a period of up to 3 
years, MLIV patients remained neurologically stable. There was a trend for 
increased cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes and increased ventricular 
size, while white matter and cerebellar volumes decreased. Mean diffusivity (MD) 
was increased and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were below normal in all 
analyzed brain regions. There was a positive correlation between motor scores of 
the Vineland Scale and the FA values in the corticospinal tract (corr coef 
0.39), and a negative correlation with the MD values (corr coef -0.50) in the 
same brain region. We conclude from these initial findings that deficiency in 
mucolipin-1 affects the entire brain but that there might be a selective 
regional cerebral neurodegenerative process in MLIV. In addition, these data 
suggest that diffusion-weighted imaging might be a good biomarker for following 
patients with MLIV. Therefore, our findings may be helpful for designing future 
clinical trials.

UDP-GlcNAc: lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase 
(GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase) is an alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) hexameric enzyme 
that catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate 
targeting signal on lysosomal hydrolases. In humans, mutations in the gene 
encoding the alpha/beta subunit precursor give rise to mucolipidosis II (MLII), 
whereas mutations in the gene encoding the gamma subunit cause the less severe 
mucolipidosis IIIC (MLIIIC). In this study we describe the phenotypic, 
histologic, and serum lysosomal enzyme abnormalities in knockout mice lacking 
the gamma subunit and compare these findings to those of mice lacking the 
alpha/beta subunits and humans with MLII and MLIIIC. We found that both lines of 
mutant mice had elevated levels of serum lysosomal enzymes and cytoplasmic 
alterations in secretory cells of several exocrine glands; however, lesions in 
gamma-subunit deficient (Gnptg(-/-)) mice were milder and more restricted in 
distribution than in alpha/beta-subunit deficient (Gnptab(-/-)) mice. We found 
that onset, extent, and severity of lesions that developed in these two 
different knockouts correlated with measured lysosomal enzyme activity; with a 
more rapid, widespread, and severe storage disease phenotype developing in 
Gnptab(-/-) mice. In contrast to mice deficient in the alpha/beta subunits, the 
mice lacking the gamma subunits were of normal size, lacked cartilage defects, 
and did not develop retinal degeneration. The milder disease in the 
gamma-subunit deficient mice correlated with residual synthesis of the mannose 
6-phosphate recognition marker. Of significance, neither strain of mutant mice 
developed cytoplasmic vacuolar inclusions in fibrocytes or mesenchymal cells 
(I-cells), the characteristic lesion associated with the prominent skeletal and 
connective tissue abnormalities in humans with MLII and MLIII. Instead, the 
predominant lesions in both lines of mice were found in the secretory epithelial 
cells of several exocrine glands, including the pancreas, and the parotid, 
submandibular salivary, nasal, lacrimal, bulbourethral, and gastric glands. The 
absence of retinal and chondrocyte lesions in Gnptg(-/-) mice might be 
attributed to residual beta-glucuronidase activity. We conclude that mice 
lacking either alpha/beta or gamma subunits displayed clinical and pathologic 
features that differed substantially from those reported in humans having 
mutations in orthologous genes.

OBJECTIVE: Type I sialidosis (ST-1) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited 
disorder. To date, there has been no study on ST-1 patients in mainland China.
METHODS: We reported in detail the cases of five Chinese ST-1 patients from two 
centers, and summarized all worldwide cases. Then, we compared the differences 
between Chinese and foreign patients.
RESULTS: A total of 77 genetically confirmed ST-1 patients were identified: 12 
from mainland China, 23 from Taiwan, 10 from other Asian regions, and 32 from 
European and American regions. The mean age of onset was 16.0 ± 6.7 years; the 
most common symptoms were myoclonus seizures (96.0%), followed by ataxia 
(94.3%), and blurred vision (67.2%). Compared to other groups, the onset age of 
patients from mainland China was much younger (10.8 ± 2.7 years). The incidence 
of visual impairment was lower in patients from other Asian regions than in 
patients from mainland China and Taiwan (28.6% vs. 81.8%-100%). Cherry-red spots 
were less frequent in the Taiwanese patients than in patients from other regions 
(27.3% vs. 55.2%-90.0%). Furthermore, 48 different mutation types were 
identified. Chinese mainland and Taiwanese patients were more likely to carry 
the c.544A > G mutation (75% and 100%, respectively) than the patients from 
other regions (only 0%-10.0%). Approximately 50% of Chinese mainland patients 
carried the c.239C > T mutation, a much higher proportion than that found in the 
other populations. In addition, although the brain MRI of most patients was 
normal, 18 F-FDG-PET analysis could reveal cerebellar and occipital lobe 
hypometabolism.
INTERPRETATION: ST-1 patients in different regions are likely to have different 
mutation types; environmental factors may influence clinical manifestations. 
Larger studies enrolling more patients are required.

Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is an ultra-rare lysosomal storage disorder caused 
by biallelic mutations in MCOLN1 gene encoding the transient receptor potential 
channel mucolipin-1. So far, 35 pathogenic or likely pathogenic MLIV-related 
variants have been described. Clinical manifestations include severe 
intellectual disability, speech deficit, progressive visual impairment leading 
to blindness, and myopathy. The severity of the condition may vary, including 
less severe psychomotor delay and/or ocular findings. As no striking 
recognizable facial dysmorphism, skeletal anomalies, organomegaly, or lysosomal 
enzyme abnormalities in serum are common features of MLIV, the clinical 
diagnosis may be significantly improved because of characteristic 
ophthalmological anomalies. This review aims to outline the pathophysiology and 
genetic defects of this condition with a focus on the genotype-phenotype 
correlation amongst cases published in the literature. The authors will present 
their own clinical observations and long-term outcomes in adult MLIV cases.

Mucolipidosis (ML) II and III alpha/beta are inherited lysosomal storage 
disorders caused by mutations in GNPTAB encoding the α/β-precursor of 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme catalyzes the initial step in the 
modification of more than 70 lysosomal enzymes with mannose 6-phosphate residues 
to ensure their intracellular targeting to lysosomes. The so-called stealth 
domains in the α- and β-subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase were thought to 
be involved in substrate recognition and/or catalysis. Here, we performed in 
silico alignment analysis of stealth domain-containing phosphotransferases and 
showed that the amino acid residues Glu389 , Asp408 , His956 , and Arg986 are 
highly conserved between different phosphotransferases. Interestingly, mutations 
in these residues were identified in patients with MLII and MLIII alpha/beta. To 
further support the in silico findings, we also provide experimental data 
demonstrating that these four amino acid residues are strictly required for 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity and thus may be directly involved in the 
enzymatic catalysis.

[I-cell disease: elucidation of the enzyme defect and its molecular biology 
significance].

[Article in Dutch]

Leroy JG.

"I-Cell disease" (ICD) has received its name because of the innumerable 
intracytoplasmatic inclusions in connective tissue cells and in vitro 
fibroblasts derived from patients. It is a progressive disorder already 
recognizable in infancy. Severe disturbance of growth, coarsening facial 
features and moderate to severe psychomotor handicap are the most important 
clinical characteristics. ICD is fatal already in childhood. Prominent among 
many anatomo- and physiopathologic abnormalities is the paradox of a very 
reduced activity of many lysosomal hydrolases in connective tissue cells on the 
one hand and the strongly enhanced activity of these hydrolases in body fluids 
and culture media on the other hand. Similar, albeit less pronounced 
abnormalities are observed also in patients with pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy, 
(PHP) a related though milder disorder. In patients with either ICZ or PHP, 
phosphorylation of oligomannosyl type sidechains in acid hydrolases, known to be 
glycoproteins, does not occur. Because the mannose-6-phosphate (M-6-P) 
recognition marker necessary for normal transport of nascent hydrolases to the 
lysosomal compartment is not formed, these enzymes are not retained in the 
cells. The underlying cause is a functionally deficient 
N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase in ICD and PHP patients. The pathological 
consequences of this defect are more pronounced in fibroblasts than in 
parenchymatous cells, because the former lack alternative mechanisms by which 
hydrolases can reach lysosomes. The number of known secondary abnormalities in 
ICD remain useful for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and for prenatal 
diagnosis. The elucidation of the metabolic defect in ICD, a rare monogenic 
disorder, has increased considerably knowledge on enzyme maturation and on the 
physiology of intracytoplasmic organelles.

Mucolipidosis type III (MLIII) gamma is a rare inherited lysosomal storage 
disorder caused by mutations in GNPTG encoding the γ-subunit of 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, the key enzyme ensuring proper intracellular 
location of multiple lysosomal enzymes. Patients with MLIII gamma typically 
present with osteoarthritis and joint stiffness, suggesting cartilage 
involvement. Using Gnptg knockout (Gnptgko ) mice as a model of the human 
disease, we showed that missorting of a number of lysosomal enzymes is 
associated with intracellular accumulation of chondroitin sulfate in Gnptgko 
chondrocytes and their impaired differentiation, as well as with altered 
microstructure of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). We also demonstrated 
distinct functional and structural properties of the Achilles tendons isolated 
from Gnptgko and Gnptab knock-in (Gnptabki ) mice, the latter displaying a more 
severe phenotype resembling mucolipidosis type II (MLII) in humans. Together 
with comparative analyses of joint mobility in MLII and MLIII patients, these 
findings provide a basis for better understanding of the molecular reasons 
leading to joint pathology in these patients. Our data suggest that lack of 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity due to defects in the γ-subunit causes 
structural changes within the ECM of connective and mechanosensitive tissues, 
such as cartilage and tendon, and eventually results in functional joint 
abnormalities typically observed in MLIII gamma patients. This idea was 
supported by a deficit of the limb motor function in Gnptgko mice challenged on 
a rotarod under fatigue-associated conditions, suggesting that the impaired 
motor performance of Gnptgko mice was caused by fatigue and/or pain at the 
joint.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first 
author of the paper.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to provide orientation for clinicians and 
radiologists to recognize the most prevalent findings leading to diagnosis in 
mucolipidosis from a description of the natural history of five Brazilian cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational and retrospective study of 
five patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of mucolipidosis. 
Clinical evaluation consisted of information obtained from records and including 
physical, neurologic, and dysmorphic evaluations. Radiologic studies consisted 
of complete skeletal radiographs of all patients. Enzyme assessment was 
performed for confirmation of the diagnosis.
RESULTS: The five patients were referred for genetic evaluation due to 
disproportionate short stature with short trunk accompanied by waddling gait. 
Age at referral varied from 11 months to 28 years. The most prevalent findings 
were joint restriction (4/5 patients), neuropsychomotor developmental delay 
(3/5), coarse facies (2/5), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (2/5), and mental 
retardation (1/4 patients). The most common radiological findings were anterior 
beaking of the vertebral bodies (5/5), shallow acetabular fossae (5/5), 
epiphyseal dysplasia (5/5), platyspondyly (4/5), pelvic dysplasia (4/5), 
decreased bone mineralization (4/5), scoliosis (3/5), wide and oar-shaped ribs 
(3/5), generalized epiphyseal ossification delay (3/5), and hypoplasia of 
basilar portions of ilea (3/5). Enzyme assessment showed α-iduronidase, 
α-mannosidase, β-glucuronidase, hexosaminidase A, and total hexosaminidase 
increased in plasma and normal glycosaminoglycans concentration. One patient was 
clinically classified as ML II and four patients as ML III.
CONCLUSIONS: The follow-up of five patients showed the typical clinical and 
radiological findings allowing the diagnosis, thus improving clinical management 
and providing adequate genetic counseling. Clinicians and radiologists can take 
advantage of the information from this work, enhancing their differential 
diagnosis ability.

BACKGROUND: Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) are a large family of inherited 
disorders characterized by abnormal endolysosomal accumulation of cellular 
material due to catabolic enzyme and transporter deficiencies. Depending on the 
affected metabolic pathway, LSD manifest with somatic or central nervous system 
(CNS) signs and symptoms. Neuroinflammation is a hallmark feature of LSD with 
CNS involvement such as mucolipidosis type IV, but not of others like Fabry 
disease.
METHODS: We investigated the properties of microglia from LSD with and without 
major CNS involvement in 2-month-old mucolipidosis type IV (Mcoln1-/-) and Fabry 
disease (Glay/-) mice, respectively, by using a combination of flow cytometric, 
RNA sequencing, biochemical, in vitro and immunofluorescence analyses.
RESULTS: We characterized microglia activation and transcriptome from 
mucolipidosis type IV and Fabry disease mice to determine if impaired lysosomal 
function is sufficient to prime these brain-resident immune cells. Consistent 
with the neurological pathology observed in mucolipidosis type IV, Mcoln1-/- 
microglia demonstrated an activation profile with a mixed 
neuroprotective/neurotoxic expression pattern similar to the one we previously 
observed in Niemann-Pick disease, type C1, another LSD with significant CNS 
involvement. In contrast, the Fabry disease microglia transcriptome revealed 
minimal alterations, consistent with the relative lack of CNS symptoms in this 
disease. The changes observed in Mcoln1-/- microglia showed significant overlap 
with alterations previously reported for other common neuroinflammatory 
disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Indeed, 
our comparison of microglia transcriptomes from Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 and mucolipidosis type IV mouse 
models showed an enrichment in "disease-associated microglia" pattern among 
these diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: The similarities in microglial transcriptomes and features of 
neuroinflammation and microglial activation in rare monogenic disorders where 
the primary metabolic disturbance is known may provide novel insights into the 
immunopathogenesis of other more common neuroinflammatory disorders.

Mucolipidosis II is a severe lysosomal storage disorder caused by defects in the 
α and β subunits of the hexameric N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase 
complex essential for the formation of the mannose 6-phosphate targeting signal 
on lysosomal enzymes. Cleavage of the membrane-bound α/β-subunit precursor by an 
unknown protease is required for catalytic activity. Here we found that the 
α/β-subunit precursor is cleaved by the site-1 protease (S1P) that activates 
sterol regulatory element-binding proteins in response to cholesterol 
deprivation. S1P-deficient cells failed to activate the α/β-subunit precursor 
and exhibited a mucolipidosis II-like phenotype. Thus, S1P functions in the 
biogenesis of lysosomes, and lipid-independent phenotypes of S1P deficiency may 
be caused by lysosomal dysfunction.

Elevated cystine levels in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with I-cell 
disease.

Tietze F, Butler JD.

Cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) 
exhibit multiple deficiency of acid hydrolase activities associated with a 
defect in the mechanism of packaging of these enzymes into lysosomes. The 
authors have examined such cells to ascertain whether the impairment of 
lysosomal function is of so broad a nature as to result in the storage of the 
amino acid cystine in a manner similar to that seen in cells derived from 
patients with cystinosis, an unrelated lysosomal storage disease of unknown 
etiology. Of 10 I-cell lines examined by automated amino acid analysis, seven 
were found to possess abnormally high levels of total free cyst(e)ine (i.e., 
greater than 1 nmole 1/2 Cys/mg protein). The mean half-cystine content of those 
I-cell lines subjected to multiple analysis ranged from 3-10 nmole/mg protein. 
levels which are comparable to those seen in homozygous cystinotic cells. The 
cystine content of several of these lines appeared to increase with subculture. 
Cultured fibroblasts from two patients with the biochemically similar, but 
clinically less severe, mucolipidosis III (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy) 
exhibited normal to marginally elevated levels of cystine, whereas cells from 
individuals with three different mucopolysaccharide storage disorders contained 
normal levels of the amino acid. It was concluded that cystine, and not 
cysteine, was the predominant form of this amino acid in these cells, because 
previous reaction of I-cell extracts with N-ethylmaleimide did not alter the 
observed cystine levels. The further identification of excess cystine in these 
cells was corroborated by analytical results obtained with a highly specific 
cystine-binding protein method as well as by high-voltage electrophoresis of 
extracts from cells pulsed with 35S-cystine. Comparative analysis of 
intracellular amino acids in normal and I-cell fibroblasts indicated that the 
elevation of csystine seen in the latter was unique to this amino acid and did 
not reflect a generalized increase in the total free amino acid content of these 
mutant cells.

Mucolipidosis II α/β, mucolipidosis III α/β, and mucolipidosis III γ are 
autosomal recessive disorders belonging to the family of lysosomal storage 
disorders caused by deficiency of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, a lysosomal 
enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) 
localized in the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for normal processing and 
packaging of soluble lysosomal enzymes with initiating the first step of tagging 
lysosomal enzymes with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P). Mucolipidosis II and III are 
caused by mutations in the GNPTAB and GNPTG genes, and patients with these 
diseases are characterized by short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and 
developmental delay. In this study we report 38 patients with mucolipidosis II 
and III enrolled in Eastern China during the past 8 years. The diagnosis was 
made based on clinical characteristics and measurement of plasma lysosomal 
enzyme activity. Sanger sequencing of GNPTAB and/or GNPTG for all patients and 
real-time quantitative PCR were performed to confirm the diagnosis. In addition, 
11 cases of prenatal mucolipidosis II were diagnosed based on measurement of the 
enzyme activity in amniotic fluid supernatant and genetic testing of cultured 
amniotic cells. Based on molecular genetic tests, 30 patients were diagnosed 
with mucolipidosis II α/β, 6 were diagnosed with III α/β and 2 were diagnosed 
with III γ. Thirty-seven different GNPTAB gene mutations were identified in 29 
patients with mucolipidosis II α/β and six patients with III α/β. These 
mutations included 22 new mutations (p.W44X, p.E279X, p.W416X, p.W463X, p.Q802X, 
p.Q882X, p.A34P, p.R334P, p.D408N, p.D534N, p.Y997C, p.D1018V, p.L1025S, 
p.L1033P, c.88_89delAC, c.890_891insT, c.1150_1151insTTA, c.1523delG, 
c.2473_2474insA, c.2980_2983delGCCT, c.3094delA, and deletion of exon 9). Four 
new GNPTG gene mutations were identified (c.13delC, p.Y81X, p.G126R and 
c.609+1delG) in two mucolipidosis III γ patients. Among the 11 cases of prenatal 
diagnosis, four were mucolipidosis II fetuses, three were heterozygous, and the 
remaining four were normal fetuses. This study expands the mutation spectrum of 
the GNPTAB and GNPTG genes and contributes to specific knowledge of 
mucolipidosis II/III in a population from Eastern China.

Sialidosis, caused by a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal sialidase gene 
(NEU1), is a systemic disease involving various tissues and organs, including 
the nervous system. Understanding the neurological dysfunction and pathology 
associated with sialidosis remains a challenge, partially due to the lack of a 
human model system. In this study, we have generated two types of induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with sialidosis-specific NEU1G227R and 
NEU1V275A/R347Q mutations (sialidosis-iPSCs), and further differentiated them 
into neural precursor cells (iNPCs). Characterization of NEU1G227R- and 
NEU1V275A/R347Q- mutated iNPCs derived from sialidosis-iPSCs (sialidosis-iNPCs) 
validated that sialidosis-iNPCs faithfully recapitulate key disease-specific 
phenotypes, including reduced NEU1 activity and impaired lysosomal and 
autophagic function. In particular, these cells showed defective differentiation 
into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, while their neuronal differentiation was 
not notably affected. Importantly, we found that the phenotypic defects of 
sialidosis-iNPCs, such as impaired differentiation capacity, could be 
effectively rescued by the induction of autophagy with rapamycin. Our results 
demonstrate the first use of a sialidosis-iNPC model with NEU1G227R- and 
NEU1V275A/R347Q- mutation(s) to study the neurological defects of sialidosis, 
particularly those related to a defective autophagy-lysosome pathway, and may 
help accelerate the development of new drugs and therapeutics to combat 
sialidosis and other LSDs.

Mucolipidosis IV.

Goutières F, Arsenio-Nunes ML, Aicardi J.

Five new cases of Mucolipidosis IV are related and the seven cases in the 
literature reviewed. Neurological signs of the disorder and the value of skin 
and conjuncitival biopsies for its diagnosis are emphasized. Arguments in favour 
of a recessive autosomic inheritance are brought forth. The disease does not 
affect exclusively Jewish people. In two cases absence of oligosacchariduria was 
demonstrated.

Mucolipidosis II is a neurometabolic lysosomal trafficking disorder of infancy 
caused by loss of mannose 6-phosphate targeting signals on lysosomal proteins, 
leading to lysosomal dysfunction and accumulation of non-degraded material. 
However, the identity of storage material and mechanisms of neurodegeneration in 
mucolipidosis II are unknown. We have generated 'knock-in' mice with a common 
mucolipidosis II patient mutation that show growth retardation, progressive 
brain atrophy, skeletal abnormalities, elevated lysosomal enzyme activities in 
serum, lysosomal storage in fibroblasts and brain and premature death, closely 
mimicking the mucolipidosis II disease in humans. The examination of affected 
mouse brains at different ages by immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural 
analysis, immunoblotting and mass spectrometric analyses of glycans and anionic 
lipids revealed that the expression and proteolytic processing of distinct 
lysosomal proteins such as α-l-fucosidase, β-hexosaminidase, α-mannosidase or 
Niemann-Pick C2 protein are more significantly impacted by the loss of mannose 
6-phosphate residues than enzymes reaching lysosomes independently of this 
targeting mechanism. As a consequence, fucosylated N-glycans, GM2 and GM3 
gangliosides, cholesterol and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate accumulate 
progressively in the brain of mucolipidosis II mice. Prominent astrogliosis and 
the accumulation of organelles and storage material in focally swollen axons 
were observed in the cerebellum and were accompanied by a loss of Purkinje 
cells. Moreover, an increased neuronal level of the microtubule-associated 
protein 1 light chain 3 and the formation of p62-positive neuronal aggregates 
indicate an impairment of constitutive autophagy in the mucolipidosis II brain. 
Our findings demonstrate the essential role of mannose 6-phosphate for selected 
lysosomal proteins to maintain the capability for degradation of sequestered 
components in lysosomes and autophagolysosomes and prevent neurodegeneration. 
These lysosomal proteins might be a potential target for a valid therapeutic 
approach for mucolipidosis II disease.

Phenotype and genotype in mucolipidoses II and III alpha/beta: a study of 61 
probands.

BACKGROUND: Mucolipidoses II and III alpha/beta (ML II and ML III) are lysosomal 
disorders in which the essential mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker is not 
synthesised on to lysosomal hydrolases and other glycoproteins. The disorders 
are caused by mutations in GNPTAB, which encodes two of three subunits of the 
heterohexameric enzyme, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase.
OBJECTIVES: Clinical, biochemical and molecular findings in 61 probands (63 
patients) are presented to provide a broad perspective of these mucolipidoses.
METHODS: GNPTAB was sequenced in all probands and/or parents. The activity of 
several lysosomal enzymes was measured in plasma, and 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase was assayed in leucocytes. Thirty-six patients were 
studied in detail, allowing extensive clinical data to be abstracted.
RESULTS: ML II correlates with near-total absence of phosphotransferase activity 
resulting from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for frameshift or 
nonsense mutations. Craniofacial and orthopaedic manifestations are evident at 
birth, skeletal findings become more obvious within the first year, and growth 
is severely impaired. Speech, ambulation and cognitive function are impaired. ML 
III retains a low level of phosphotransferase activity because of at least one 
missense or splice site mutation. The phenotype is milder, with minimal delays 
in milestones, the appearance of facial coarsening by early school age, and 
slowing of growth after the age of 4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-one pathogenic changes in GNPTAB are presented, including 42 
novel mutations. Ample clinical information improves criteria for delineation of 
ML II and ML III. Phenotype-genotype correlations suggested in more general 
terms in earlier reports on smaller groups of patients are specified and 
extended.

Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Organization for Medical Research, Japan.

To gain insight into the pathogenesis of sialidosis type 1, we performed 
molecular investigations of two unrelated Japanese patients. Both of them are 
compound heterozygotes for base substitutions of 649G-to-A and 727G-to-A, which 
result in amino acid alterations V217M and G243R, respectively. Using homology 
modeling, the structure of human lysosomal neuraminidase was constructed and the 
structural changes caused by these missense mutations were deduced. The 
predicted change due to V217M was smaller than that caused by G243R, the latter 
resulting in a drastic, widespread alteration. The overexpressed gene products 
containing these mutations had the same molecular weight as that of the wild 
type, although the amounts of the products were moderately decreased. A 
biochemical study demonstrated that the expressed neuraminidase containing a 
V217M mutation was partly transported to lysosomes and showed residual enzyme 
activity, although a G243R mutant was retained in the endoplasmic 
reticulum/Golgi area and had completely lost the enzyme activity. Considering 
the data, we surmise that the V217M substitution may be closely associated with 
the phenotype of sialidosis type 1 with a late onset and moderate clinical 
course.

BACKGROUND: Sialidosis is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by a 
deficit of neuraminidase enzyme activity. Patients with sialidosis present 
various neurological disorders such as: myoclonic epilepsy and hypotonia, often 
associated with visual impairment. A typical aspect of sialidosis is the finding 
of a macular cherry-red spot on ocular fundus examination. In this paper we 
describe a unilateral case of Bergmeister's papilla (BP) in a young female 
patient suffering from type 1 sialidosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old young woman suffering from type 1 sialidosis, 
confirmed by previously described compound heterozigosity Leu91Arg and Gly328Ser 
on N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminidase - 1 (NEU1) gene, underwent an opthalmological 
examination at the Eye Clinic of the University of Campania L. Vanvitelli, for 
bilateral visual deterioration. The patient was suffering from myoclonic 
epilepsy with hypotonia and severe motor disability. Fundoscopic examination 
showed a typical macular cherry-red spot with retinal pigment epithelium 
dystrophy in the middle periphery, in both eyes. Furthermore, in the left eye 
(OS), a vitreous thickening was observed in the nasal sector of the optic disc, 
remnant of fetal vasculature on the optic disc (Bergmeister's papilla). Optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) showed, in both eyes, a thickening of the ganglion 
cell layer (GCL) with a hyperreflective opacity as a cap on the left optic disc.
CONCLUSIONS: In our paper we have described, for the first time in literature, a 
case of BP in a patient with type 1 sialidosis. The detection of BP with 
thickening of the peripapillary vitreous by SD-OCT is useful in monitoring any 
vitreo-retinal change that could cause future visual deterioration.

Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) and mucolipidoses (ML) are groups of lysosomal 
storage disorders in which lysosomal hydrolases are deficient leading to 
accumulation of undegraded glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), throughout the body, 
subsequently resulting in progressive damage to multiple tissues and organs. 
Assays using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) have been established to measure 
GAGs in serum or plasma from MPS and ML patients, but few studies were performed 
to determine whether these assays are sufficiently robust to measure GAG levels 
in dried blood spots (DBS) of patients with MPS and ML.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we evaluated GAG levels in DBS samples from 
124 MPS and ML patients (MPS I=16; MPS II=21; MPS III=40; MPS IV=32; MPS VI=10; 
MPS VII=1; ML=4), and compared them with 115 age-matched controls. Disaccharides 
were produced from polymer GAGs by digestion with chondroitinase B, 
heparitinase, and keratanase II. Subsequently, dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan 
sulfate (HS-0S, HS-NS), and keratan sulfate (mono-sulfated KS, di-sulfated KS, 
and ratio of di-sulfated KS in total KS) were measured by MS/MS.
RESULTS: Untreated patients with MPS I, II, VI, and ML had higher levels of DS 
compared to control samples. Untreated patients with MPS I, II, III, VI, and ML 
had higher levels of HS-0S; and untreated patients with MPS II, III and VI and 
ML had higher levels of HS-NS. Levels of KS were age dependent, so although 
levels of both mono-sulfated KS and di-sulfated KS were generally higher in 
patients, particularly for MPS II and MPS IV, age group numbers were not 
sufficient to determine significance of such changes. However, the ratio of 
di-sulfated KS in total KS was significantly higher in all MPS patients younger 
than 5years old, compared to age-matched controls. MPS I and VI patients treated 
with HSCT had normal levels of DS, and MPS I, VI, and VII treated with ERT or 
HSCT had normal levels of HS-0S and HS-NS, indicating that both treatments are 
effective in decreasing blood GAG levels.
CONCLUSION: Measurement of GAG levels in DBS is useful for diagnosis and 
potentially for monitoring the therapeutic efficacy in MPS.

Mucolipidosis (ML) (OMIM 607840 & 607838) is a rare autosomal recessive 
inherited disorder that occurs due to the deficiency of golgi enzyme uridine 
diphosphate (UDP)- N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase 
(GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) responsible for tagging mannose-6-phosphate for 
proper trafficking of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. Variants in 
GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (GNPTAB (α, β subunits) and GNPTG (γ subunits) are 
known to result in impaired targeting of lysosomal enzymes leading to 
Mucolipidosis (ML) Type II or Type III. We analyzed 69 Indian families of 
MLII/III for clinical features and molecular spectrum and performed in silico 
analysis for novel variants. We identified 38 pathogenic variants in GNPTAB and 
5 pathogenic variants in GNPTG genes including missense, frame shift, deletion, 
duplication and splice site variations. A total of 26 novel variants were 
identified in GNPTAB and 4 in GNPTG gene. In silico studies using mutation 
prediction software like SIFT, Polyphen2 and protein structure analysis further 
confirmed the pathogenic nature of the novel sequence variants detected in our 
study. Except for a common variant c.3503_3504delTC in early onset MLII, we 
could not establish any other significant genotype and phenotype correlation. 
This is one of the largest studies reported till date on Mucolipidosis II/III in 
order to identify mutation spectrum and any recurrent mutations specific to the 
Indian ethnic population. The mutational spectrum information in Indian patients 
will be useful in better genetic counselling, carrier detection and prenatal 
diagnosis for patients with ML II/III.

BACKGROUND: Mucolipidosis alpha/beta is an inborn error of metabolism 
characterized by deficiency of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, in which essential 
alpha/beta subunits are encoded by the GNPTAB gene. The autosomal recessive 
condition is due to disruptions of hydrolase mannose 6-phosphate marker 
generation, defective lysosomal targeting and subsequent intracellular 
accumulation of non-degraded material. Clinical severity depends on residual 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity, which distinguishes between the milder 
type III disease and the severe, neonatal onset type II disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical, biochemical and genetic diagnosis of 
mucolipidosis III alpha/beta in a two-year-old Chinese boy who initially 
presented with poor weight gain, microcephaly and increased tone. He was 
confirmed to harbor the common splice site mutation c.2715 + 1G > A and the 
nonsense variant c.2404C > T (p.Q802*). Clinically, the patient had multiple 
phenotypic features typical of mucopolysaccharidosis including joint 
contractures, coarse facial features, kypho-lordosis, pectus carinatum and 
umbilical hernia. However, the relatively mild developmental delay compared to 
severe type I and type II mucopolysaccharidosis and the absence of macrocephaly 
raised the possibility of the less commonly diagnosed mucolipidosis alpha/beta. 
Critical roles of lysosomal enzyme activity assay, which showed elevated 
α-iduronidase, iduronate sulfatase, galactose-6-sulphate sulphatase, 
arylsulfatase B and α-hexosaminidase activities; and genetic study, which 
confirmed the parental origin of both mutations, were highlighted.
CONCLUSIONS: The recently reported nonsense variant c.2404C > T in the GNPTAB 
gene is further recognized and this contributes to the genotype-phenotype 
spectrum of mucolipidosis alpha/beta.

Type II sialidosis: review of the clinical spectrum and identification of a new 
splicing defect with chitotriosidase assessment in two patients.

Messeri A, Guerrini R, Zammarchi E, Donati MA, Morrone A.

Sialidosis is a lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of 
alpha-N-acetyl neuraminidase-1 (NEU1). Sialidosis is classified into two main 
clinical variants: Type I, the milder form of the disease, and Type II, which 
can in turn be subdivided into three forms: congenital, infantile and juvenile. 
We report herein the clinical, biochemical and molecular characterisation of two 
patients with Type II sialidosis exhibiting the congenital (P1) and infantile 
forms (P2). We also review clinical data on the rare Type II forms of sialidosis 
in the hope of improving understanding of the disorder and facilitating its 
diagnosis. The genetic characterization of the two patients showed one known [c. 
679G > A (p.G227R)] NEU1 missense mutation (detected in P2), and the new c.807 + 
1G > A splicing defect (detected in P1), a genetic lesion that is extremely rare 
in this disease. Interestingly, P2 presented an extremely elevated level of 
chitotriosidase in plasma. This is the first pathological detection of 
chitotriosidase in sialidosis patients.

Demonstration of the heterozygous state for I-cell disease and pseudo-Hurler 
polydystrophy by assay of N-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferase in white blood 
cells and fibroblasts.

Varki A, Reitman ML, Vannier A, Kornfeld S, Grubb JH, Sly WS.

The biochemical abnormalities of I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) and 
pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis III) can be explained by a deficiency 
of the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. We demonstrate here that obligate 
heterozygotes for these autosomal recessive diseases have intermediate levels of 
this enzymatic activity in homogenates of peripheral blood white cells and in 
extracts from cultured fibroblasts. This finding provides further evidence that 
the enzyme deficiency is the primary genetic defect in these diseases. In 
addition, the previous observation that obligate heterozygotes for mucolipidosis 
III have elevations of total serum beta-hexosaminidase outside the range of 
normal was confirmed. In studies of three pedigrees of patients with 
mucolipidosis III, these techniques were used to score individuals at risk for 
the carrier state.

Mucolipidosis types II and III are autosomal recessive inherited diseases caused 
by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1 phosphotransferase 
(GlcNAc-phosphotransferase), which adds phosphate to function as a recognition 
marker for the uptake and transport of lysosomal enzymes. We investigated 
mutations in the GNPTA (MGC4170) gene, which codes for the alpha/beta subunits 
of phosphotransferase, and in the GNPTAG gene, which codes for its gamma 
subunits in five Korean patients with mucolipidosis type II or IIIA. We 
identified seven mutations in the GNPTA gene, but none in GNPTAG. The mutations 
in type II patients included p.Q104X (c.310C>T), p.R1189X (c.3565C>T), p.S1058X 
(c.3173C>G), p.W894X (c.2681G>A), and p.H1158fsX15 (c.3474_3475delTA), all of 
which are nonsense or frameshift mutations. However, a splicing site mutation, 
IVS13+1G>A (c.2715+1G>A) was detected along with a nonsense or a frameshift 
mutation (p.R1189X or p.E858fsX3 (c.2574_2575delGA)) in two mucolipidosis type 
IIIA patients. This report shows that mutations in the GNPTA gene coding for the 
alpha/beta subunits of phosphotransferase, and not mutations in the GNPTAG gene, 
account for most of the genetic mutations found in Korean patients with 
mucolipidosis type II or IIIA.

BACKGROUND: Mucolipidosis types II and III (ML II/III) are autosomal recessive 
disorders caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. We investigated the molecular genetic 
characteristics of the GNPTAB gene, which codes for the alpha/beta subunits of a 
phosphotransferase, in Korean ML II/III patients. We included prenatal tests and 
evaluated the spectrum of mutations in East Asian populations with ML II/III 
through a literature review.
METHODS: Seven patients from six families were enrolled in the study including 
two prenatal tests using chorionic villi samples. A diagnosis of ML II/III was 
made based on clinical findings and increases in serum lysosomal enzyme levels. 
PCR and direct sequencing were performed to identify GNPTAB mutations.
RESULTS: We found 14 mutant alleles including seven known mutations of 
c.2189delT (p.Leu730fs*7), c.1090C > T (p.Arg364*), c.2681G > A (p.Trp894*), 
c.3565C > T (p.Arg1189*), c.310C > T (p.Gln104*), c.1071G > A (p.Trp357*) and 
c.2574_2575delGA (p.Asn859Glnfs*2). Four were novel variants of unknown 
significance: c.992A > G (p.Tyr331Cys), c.2666 T > A (p.Leu889*), c.637-6 T > G 
(p.Thr213Phefs*11), and c.471_472delTT (p.Tyr158Serfs*8). Family studies 
revealed the probands to be compound heterozygotes. The fetuses carried the same 
GNPTAB mutations as the mucolipidosis II/III probands in the prenatal diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified GNPTAB mutations in all patients with ML II/III, but 
did not identify a hot spot in Korean patients. We successfully performed 
prenatal diagnosis using molecular investigation.

BACKGROUND: Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is an autosomal recessive disease 
caused by mutations in the MCOLN1 gene that codes for mucolipin, a member of the 
transient receptor potential (TRP) gene family.
OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively characterize the clinical and genetic 
abnormalities of MLIV.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with MLIV, aged 2 to 25 years, were studied. Ten 
returned for follow-up every 1 to 2 years for up to 5 years. Standard clinical, 
neuroimaging, neurophysiologic, and genetic techniques were used.
RESULTS: All patients had varying degrees of corneal clouding, with progressive 
optic atrophy and retinal dystrophy. Twenty-three patients had severe motor and 
mental impairment. Motor function deteriorated in three patients and remained 
stable in the rest. All had a constitutive achlorhydria with elevated plasma 
gastrin level, and 12 had iron deficiency or anemia. Head MRI showed consistent 
characteristic findings of a thin corpus callosum and remained unchanged during 
the follow-up period. Prominent abnormalities of speech, hand usage, and 
swallowing were also noted. Mutations in the MCOLN1 gene were present in all 
patients. Correlation of the genotype with the neurologic handicap and corpus 
callosum dysplasia was found.
CONCLUSIONS: MLIV is both a developmental and a degenerative disorder. The 
presentation as a cerebral palsy-like encephalopathy may delay diagnosis.

The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) is characterized by accumulation of 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and mucolipidosis (ML) by accumulation of GAGs and 
sphingolipids. Each type of MPS accumulates specific GAGs. The lysosomal enzymes 
N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphate sulphatase and beta-galactosidase involve the 
stepwise degradation of keratan sulphate (KS). Deficiency of these enzymes 
results in elevation of KS levels in the body fluids and in tissues, leading to 
MPS IV disease. In this study, we evaluated blood and urine KS levels in types 
of MPS and ML other than MPS IV. Eighty-five plasma samples came from MPS I (n = 
18), MPS II (n = 28), MPS III (n = 20), MPS VI (n = 3), MPS VII (n = 5) and ML 
(n = 11) patients while 127 urine samples came from MPS I (n = 34), MPS II (n = 
34), MPS III (n = 32), MPS VI (n = 7), MPS VII (n = 9) and ML (n = 11) patients. 
KS levels were determined using the ELISA method. Plasma KS levels varied with 
age in both control and patient populations. In all age groups, the mean values 
of plasma KS in MPS and ML patients were significantly higher than those in the 
age-matched controls. Plasma KS values in four newborn patients were above the 
mean + 2SD of the age-matched controls (mean, 41 ng/ml). Overall, 85.9% of 
individual values in non-type IV MPS and ML patients were above the mean + 2SD 
of the age-matched controls. For urine KS levels, 24.4% of individual values in 
patients were above the mean + 2SD of the age-matched controls. In conclusion, 
KS in blood is elevated in each type of non-type IV MPS examined, in contrast to 
the conventional understanding. This finding suggests that measurement of KS 
level provides a new diagnostic biomarker in a wide variety of 
mucopolysaccharidoses and mucolipidoses in addition to MPS IV.

Inherited MYO5B mutations have recently been associated with microvillus 
inclusion disease (MVID), an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by 
intractable, life-threatening, watery diarrhea appearing shortly after birth. 
Characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease and 
development of novel therapeutic approaches is hampered by the lack of animal 
models. In this study we describe the phenotype of a novel mouse model with 
targeted inactivation of Myo5b. Myo5b knockout mice show perinatal mortality, 
diarrhea and the characteristic mislocalization of apical and basolateral plasma 
membrane markers in enterocytes. Moreover, in transmission electron 
preparations, we observed microvillus atrophy and the presence of microvillus 
inclusion bodies. Importantly, Myo5b knockout embryos at day 20 of gestation 
already display all these structural defects, indicating that they are tissue 
autonomous rather than secondary to environmental cues, such as the long-term 
absence of nutrients in the intestine. Myo5b knockout mice closely resemble the 
phenotype of MVID patients and constitute a useful model to further investigate 
the underlying molecular mechanism of this disease and to preclinically assess 
the efficacy of novel therapeutic approaches.

Mucolipidosis type IV is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease of 
unknown etiology that causes severe neurological and ophthalmological 
abnormalities. In an attempt to obtain insight into the nature of the metabolic 
abnormality in this disorder, we prospectively evaluated 15 consecutive 
patients, aged 2 to 23 years, over a period of 22 months. The finding of iron 
deficiency in some of the patients led us to the discovery that all patients but 
one had markedly elevated blood gastrin levels. None had vitamin B12 deficiency. 
Gastroscopy in three patients showed normal gross appearance of the mucosa in 
two patients, 4 and 7 years old, and mucosal atrophy in a 22-year-old. Parietal 
cells were present in normal numbers and contained large cytoplasmic inclusions 
that were confirmed immunohistochemically to be lysosomal in nature. Other 
gastric epithelial cells appeared normal. Parietal cells contained very few 
tubulovesicular membranes, suggesting cellular activation, whereas apical 
canaliculi appeared relatively nonactivated. Both subunits of the parietal cell 
H+/K+-ATPase were present, and both partially colocalized with f-actin at the 
apical membrane. We conclude that patients with mucolipidosis type IV are 
constitutively achlorhydric and have partially activated parietal cells. We 
hypothesize that the defective protein in this disease is closely associated 
with the final stages of parietal cell activation and is critical for a specific 
type of cellular vacuolar trafficking between the cytoplasm and the apical 
membrane domain.

There is evidence that lysosomal proteases mediate the intracellular degradation 
of structurally abnormal collagen. I-Cell disease (Mucolipidosis II) is 
characterized by marked deficiency of many lysosomal hydrolases, including the 
collagenolytic enzyme cathepsin B. The experiments reported here tested the 
hypothesis that degradation of abnormal collagen would be severely impaired in 
I-cells. Skin fibroblasts from 3 patients with I-cell disease were incubated 
with and without cis-hydroxyproline, a proline analog that causes structural 
abnormalities in collagen, and [14C]proline. The amount of [14C]hydroxyproline 
in a low molecular weight fraction relative to total [14C]hydroxyproline was 
used as a measure of intracellular collagen degradation. Levels of degradation 
were significantly higher in I-cells exposed to cis-hydroxyproline than in cells 
incubated without the analog. Similar data were obtained for normal human fetal 
lung fibroblasts incubated under the same conditions. Degradation of 
[125I]-epidermal growth factor was used to assess the functionality of the 
lysosomal pathway for protein degradation, and it was much lower in I-cells than 
in normal cells. It can be concluded that a completely functional complement of 
lysosomal enzymes is not necessary for structurally abnormal collagen to be 
degraded intracellularly; the data suggest that a nonlysosomal pathway exists.

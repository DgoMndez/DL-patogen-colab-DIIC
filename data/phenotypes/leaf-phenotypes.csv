HP:0002172;Postural instability;"A tendency to fall or the inability to keep oneself from falling; imbalance. The retropulsion test is widely regarded as the gold standard to evaluate postural instability, Use of the retropulsion test includes a rapid balance perturbation in the backward direction, and the number of balance correcting steps (or total absence thereof) is used to rate the degree of postural instability. Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps. Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal. Markedly affected patients continue to step backward without ever regaining their balance and must be caught by the examiner (this would be called true retropulsion). Even more severely affected patients fail to correct entirely, and fall backward like a pushed toy soldier, without taking any corrective steps. [PMID:25613349]"

HP:0002515;Waddling gait;Weakness of the hip girdle and upper thigh muscles, for instance in myopathies, leads to an instability of the pelvis on standing and walking. If the muscles extending the hip joint are affected, the posture in that joint becomes flexed and lumbar lordosis increases. The patients usually have difficulties standing up from a sitting position. Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck.

HP:0002623;Overriding aorta;An overriding aorta is a congenital heart defect where the aorta is positioned directly over a ventricular septal defect, instead of over the left ventricle. The result is that the aorta receives some blood from the right ventricle, which reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. It is one of the four conditions of the Tetralogy of Fallot. The aortic root can be displaced toward the front (anteriorly) or directly above the septal defect, but it is always abnormally located to the right of the root of the pulmonary artery. The degree of override is quite variable, with 5-95% of the valve being connected to the right ventricle. [HPO:curators]

HP:0002632;Low-to-normal blood pressure;
HP:0002635;Type IV atherosclerotic lesion;In type IV atherosclerotic lesions a dense accumulation of extracellular lipid occupies an extensive but well-defined region of the intima. This type of extracellular lipid accumulation is known as the lipid core. A fibrous tissue increase is not a feature, and complications such as defects of the lesion surface and thrombosis are not present. The type IV lesion is also known as atheroma. Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type. Thus, atheroma is, at least initially, an eccentric lesion. [PMID:7648691]

HP:0002639;Budd-Chiari syndrome;Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is caused by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow at any level from the small hepatic veins to the junction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with the right atrium, 1 and occurs in 1/100,000 of the general population worldwide. The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience. [HPO:probinson, PMID:16265183]

One example is rheumatoid arthritis. Another cause are conditions that tighten up the small (intrinsic) muscles of the hand and fingers, for example hand trauma or nerve disorders, such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, or stroke.

HP:0030733;Vesicoallantoic abdominal wall defect;"An abdominal wall defected related to a developmental anomaly of the allantois, which is an embryonic structure that develops as a diverticulum off the yolk sac at about 16 days post fertilization. During further development, the allantois becomes incorporated into the body of the embryo, connecting the ventral aspect of the urogenital sinus (which will develop into the upper pole of the urinary bladder) to the external portion of the umbilicus. Upon further development, the lumen of the allantois becomes obliterated and forms a thick fibrous cord called the urachus, which connects the apex of the bladder to the umbilicus. In adults, the urachus is known as the median umbilical ligament. Failure of the allantoic cavity to obliterate can result of one of four conditions: 1) congenital patent urachus (a completely open connection between bladder and umbilicus); 2) vesicourachal diverticulum (a diverticulum off the bladder but not communicating with the umbilicus); umbilical cyst and sinus (not communicating with the bladder); and 4) alternating urachal sinus.

HP:0031420;Small yellow foveal lesion with surrounding gray zone;A lesion that is observed following light damage to the macula. Damage to the retinal by exposure to intense visible light, usually the sun. Intense light exposure such as staring at the sun causes fine structural anomalies in the outer segments of the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells of the macula. Symptoms usually develop within 1 to 4 h after exposure and include decreased vision, metamorphopsia, micropsia, and central or paracentral scotomas. Fundus examination typically shows a small yellow spot with a surrounding gray zone in the foveolar or parafoveolar area. Spontaneous evolution leads to the improvement of visual acuity.

HP:0031570;Tessier number 0 facial cleft;A Number 0 Tessier cleft is a true median cleft lip with a broad columella and bifid nasal tip. The alveolar cleft is between the central incisors. The nasal septum may be thickened, duplicated, or absent. The nasal bridge is usually broad with associated orbital hypertelorism. The midline soft tissue anomaly may range from a mild broadening of the philtrum or there may be a true median cleft lip. The columella and nasal tip are typically bifid and broadened with a midline depression. The alae nasi are intact but laterally displaced. The nose appears shortened in the vertical dimension. [PMID:2503273]
HP:0031572;Tessier number 1 facial cleft;"As seen in a typical cleft lip, a cleft of the lip is found in the region of the cupid's bow. The nostril is cleft through the alar dome and extends above onto the nasal dorsum. It passes medial to a normal, but dys- topic, medial canthus. There is an alveolar cleft between the central and lateral incisors that extends above through the pyriform margin lateral to the anterior nasal spine; the nasal septum is not involved. The bony cleft extends through the nasal bone or between the junction of the nasal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. Above the cleft lip, the clefting of the alar dome is associated with deviation to the opposite side of the shortened and broadened columella and nasal tip. Extension of the soft tissue cleft onto the nasal dorsum can be manifest as a series of vertical soft tissue furrows and ridges. Vertical inner canthal dysto- pia and severe telecanthus mark the superior aspect of the Number 1 facial cleft. A cranial soft tissue extension characterized by a tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline delineates the number 13 cleft. Skeletal clefting of the maxilla may extend posteriorly to form a complete cleft of the hard and soft palate. The maxilla is hypoplastic in all three dimensions. There is a keel-shaped alveolus and anterior open bite. Normal septation is preserved between the nasal cavity and the hypoplastic maxillary antrum on the affected side. Distortion of the nasal skeleton produces gross flattening of the nasal dorsum. There is asymmetry of the pterygoid plates, of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid, and of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. The distortion of the cranial base may result in a mild plagiocephaly. [PMID:2503273]"
HP:0031573;Tessier number 2 facial cleft;As is typically seen in isolated cleft cases, a cleft of the lip is present. There is hypoplasia, but not true notching of the ala nasi with flattening of the lateral part of the nose. The nasal root is broadened, with lateral displacement of the inner canthus. The palpebral fissure and lacrimal drainage system are not disturbed. The alveolar cleft is through the lateral incisor area and extends to the pyriform aperture. There is normal septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus. Notching at the junction between the nasal bone is present, as is a broad, flat frontal process of the maxilla. Transverse ethmoid enlargement produces orbital hypertelorism. Above the cleft of the lip and palate is a true broad cleft of the nostril that is medial to the intact, but laterally displaced, tail of the alar cartilage. A shallow soft tissue groove extends superiorly to the asymmetrically widened nasal root. The lacrimal system, palpebral fissures, and eyebrows remain intact. The alveolar cleft extends posteriorly as a complete unilateral cleft of the hard and soft palate. The nasal septum is intact but deviated to the opposite side. The nasal cavity remains separated from the normally pneumatized, although hypoplastic, maxilla on the cleft side. Above the nasomaxillary notching, the ethmoid sinus is less well developed, and there is no pneumatization of the frontal sinus on this side. Anterior rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid occurs on the cleft side in relation to the narrower orbit and smaller ethmoid sinus. There is mild asymmetry of the anterior cranial fossa, which is narrower on the cleft side. The cranium is brachycephalic with marked occipital flattening. [PMID:2503273]
HP:0031575;Tessier number 3 facial cleft;"As in the Number 1 and Number 2 clefts, this cleft extends through the lip in the region of the typical cleft lip; however, it does not extend through the base. The cleft continues superiorly to involve the inner canthus and lower eyelid medial to the inferior lacrimal punctum, thereby disrupting the nasolacrimal system. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft is between the lateral incisor and the canine. Absent septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary antrum, together with the distortion of the frontal process of the maxilla and lacrimal fossa, produces direct communication between the orbit, maxillary sinus, and nose. There is hypoplasia of the soft tissue margins of the cleft in the vertical dimension. This produces extreme soft tissue deficiency between the alar base and the cleft of the medial aspect of the lower eyelid. The inferior lacrimal punctum is evident at the lateral margin of the lower eyelid cleft. The lacrimal drainage system ends as an opening directly onto the cheek without communication into the nasal cavity. The globe is normal in size, but it is displaced inferiorly and laterally. The nasal septum shows the characteristic distortion seen in typical cleft lip and palate. There is absence of septation between the nasal cavity on the cleft side and the maxilla. The maxilla is hypoplastic in three dimensions, with a marked reduction in pneumatization. Superior extension of the skeletal clefting into the medial portion of the orbital floor and into the inferior orbital rim in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla allows direct communication between the orbit above and the nasomaxillary region below. There is mild narrowing of the ethmoid sinus and of the body of the sphenoid on the cleft side. The pterygoid process appears anatomically normal, but less displaced from the midline compared with that of the noncleft side. Both the orbit and the floor of the anterior cranial fossa are inferiorly displaced. [PMID:2503273]"
HP:0031576;Tessier number 4 facial cleft;"The cleft lip is midway between the philtral ridge and the commissure of the mouth. The cleft is lateral to the normally shaped and placed nasal ala and passes onto the cheek. The cleft extends through the lower eyelid lateral to the punctum. The lacrimal system and inner canthus are normal. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft passes between the lateral incisor and canine, as in the Number 3 cleft. The cleft passes around the pyriform aperture and continues through the portion of the maxillary sinus medial to the infraorbital foramen. The cleft terminates at the medial end of the inferior orbital rim. There is severe vertical soft tissue deficiency in a Number 4 cleft, with the medial margins of the cleft lip extending directly into the medially placed cleft of the lower eyelid. Within the medial segment of the right-sided cleft lip, muscle elements are apparently absent. Muscle bunching is noted in the ipsilateral lateral lip segment, as is seen in a typical unilateral cleft lip. The anatomically normal nasal ala is superiorly displaced in association with a severe deficiency in the overall nasal length. Marked dystopia of the right globe results in its inferior displacement into the medially deficient orbital floor and inferior rim. Both globes are otherwise normal. The complete palatal cleft passes through the maxilla medial to the infraorbital foramen and extends to the medial portion of the inferior orbital rim without evidence of an intact maxillary sinus. Bony septation persists medially, thereby separating the nasal cavity from the orbit, maxillary sinus, and mouth, which are contiguous. Marked midfacial hypoplasia is present. The cleft is manifest as asymmetry of the body of the sphenoid; it is smaller on the right, with asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The orbital floor cleft has no communication with the inferior orbital fissure. The cleft does not extend to the skull base, but there is marked facial asymmetry associated with plagiocephaly.

HP:0031577;Tessier number 5 facial cleft;The cleft of the lip is just medial to the oral commissure and extends across the cheek as a furrow. It ends as a cleft at the junction of the middle and lateral third of the lower eyelid. Microphthalmia is frequently present. The alveolar cleft is through the premolar region and extends superiorly through the orbit at the inferolateral part of the rim and floor. There is a vertical soft tissue deficiency between the lateral portion of the lip and the lower eyelid cleft. The left side of the nose shows vertical shortening, and the left alar base is displaced superiorly. Facial asymmetry secondary to the skeletal abnormality is reflected by a vertical orbital dystopia. However, bothglobes are normal, and there is no abnormality of the upper eyelids, eyebrow, forehead, or frontal hairline. The skeletal clefts vary, ranging from a narrow skeletal furrow that traverses the anterior maxillary wall as on the rightto a broad cleft of the maxilla lateral to the infraorbital foramen and maxillary sinus. This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The right-sided pterygoid plates are smaller and closer to the midline. There is minimal asymmetry of the cranial base and calvarium. [PMID:2503273]
HP:0031578;Tessier number 6 facial cleft;"A facial cleft extending from the zygomatic arch to the eye. This zygomaticomaxillary cleft is similar to that typically found in Treacher Collins syndrome. The overlying tissue shows a vertical sclerodermic furrow radiating from the labial commissure or the angle of the mandible across the cheek to a coloboma of the lower eyelid between the middle and lateral one-third. Microphthalmia is not observed. The skeletal cleft is between the maxilla and zygoma; it passes through the inferolateral orbital rim to enter the inferior orbital fissure. No alveolar cleft is present. The zygomatic arch is intact. The soft tissue furrow, which is more apparent on the right, radiates from the oral commissure toward the lateral two-thirds of the lower eyelid. The antimongoloid obliquity of the palpebral fissures is associated with laterally placed lower eyelid clefts and some ectropion. A left-sided anophthalmia is accompanied by adjacent soft tissue hypoplasia and is reflected in a short palpebral fissure, enophthalmos, and minor ptosis of the eyebrow. No abnormality is present in the alveolar arch except for some tilting of the occlusal plane secondary to hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla. There is a vertical bony groove in the region of the zygomaticomaxillary suture that ends in the inferolateral portion of a small bony orbit. More laterally, the remainder of the zygomatic body and arch is normal in both shape and dimension. The lateral orbital floor is downslanting but intact, and it lacks direct communication with the temporal or infratemporal fossae. The hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla and orbit is associated with a reduction in the transverse and anteroposterior dimensions of the anterior cranial fossa; mild asymmetry of the middle cranial fossa and calvarium is present. No significant asymmetry of size, shape, or position is present in the sphenoid. [PMID:2503273]"
HP:0031579;Tessier number 7 facial cleft;The temporozygomatic Number 7 cleft is found in both Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia. Soft tissue manifestations include macrostomia, malformations of the external and middle ear, temporalis muscle, variable involvement of the seventh cranial nerve (in hemifacial microsomia), and abnormalities of the preauricular hair in Treacher Collins syndrome. The skeletal cleft is through the pterygomaxillary junction, and vertical maxillary hypoplasia is present. In addition, abnormality of the mandibular ramus, coronoid, and condyle and absence of the zygomatic arch are typically present. A soft tissue furrow extends from the macrostomia laterally and superiorly across the cheek toward the preauricular hairline. The lower eyelids are intact. The anatomy of the external ear is normal, and there are no preauricular tags. Bony clefting is through the pterygomaxillary junction with hypoplasia of the alveolar process in the molar region, thereby producing a posterior open bite. The maxilla is hypoplastic, although the maxillary sinuses are symmetrically pneumatized. The hypoplastic zygomatic body arches upward, but then it takes a downward course and is severely malformed and displaced. The zygoma is continuous posteriorly with an apparently normal zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The mandibular condyle and coronoid process are hypoplastic and asymmetric. There is no antegonial notching of the mandible. Marked cranial base asymmetry, with tilting and asymmetric positioning of the temporomandibular articulations, is present. The anatomy of the sphenoid is abnormal, especially on the right where there is no recognizable medial or lateral pterygoid plate. [PMID:2503273]
HP:0031580;Tessier number 8 facial cleft;"The frontozygomatic or Number 8 cleft is found in both Treacher Collins syndrome and the Goldenhar variant of hemifacial microsomia. Skeletal defects are more prominent in Treacher Collins syndrome, whereas the soft tissue clefting is more typical in cases of ''Goldenhar syndrome''. Soft tissue clefting presents as a dermatocele, a true lateral eyelid coloboma with absence of the outer canthus, and anomalies of the globe itself, especially epibulbar cysts in patients with Goldenhar syndrome. The frontozygomatic bony cleft produces absence of the lateral orbital rim; this border now is formed by the hypoplastic greater wing of the sphenoid. The absence of bony support for the outer canthus produces lateral canthal dystopia and the characteristic antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures. Secondary to the bony deficiency in the lateral orbital wall and floor, there is soft tissue continuity between the orbit, temporal fossa, and infratemporal region. Preauricular hairline indicators delineate the Number 8 cleft as the first of the northbound clefts. Complete absence of the bony lateral orbital wall and rim constitute the skeletal element of the Number 8 cleft. The lateral border of the orbit is formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid from which small spicules of bone, which represent the rudimentary zygoma, may be found in Treacher Collins syndrome. The symmetry of the facial anomalies is reflected in the apparently normal symmetric anterior and middle cranial fossae. [PMID:2503273]"
HP:0031581;Tessier number 9 facial cleft;This is an upper lateral orbital cleft. The soft tissue deformity is in the lateral one-third of the upper eyelid, and the bony cleft is through the superolateral orbital angle. Microphthalmia is present. The superolateral bony deficiency of the orbits allows a lateral displacement of the globes. The lateral one-third of the upper eyelid and the outer canthus are distorted, thus preventing apposition to the globe. The upper eyelid does not have a true cleft. A soft tissue furrow radiates superiorly and posterisphenoid is symmetric and normal. Mild cranial base asymmetry is reflected in the pterygoid plates. The left pair is more laterally displaced from the midline. Skull vault plagiocephaly is evident with an apparent reduction in the anteroposterior dimension of the anterior cranial fossa. [PMID:2503273]
HP:0031582;Tessier number 10 facial cleft;In a Number 10 Tessier cleft there is an upper central orbital cleft with a cleft of the middle one-third of the upper eyelid, which often results in total ablepharia. The eyebrow is disrupted, being virtually absent medially, whereas the lateral portion angles upward toward the frontal hairline. There may be ocular anomalies, including colobomata of the iris. The skeletal cleft is through the midportion of the supraorbital rim, the adjacent frontal bone, and the orbital roof lateral to the supraorbital nerve. A frontal encephalocele frequently occupies the frontal bony cleft. The palpebral fissure is grossly elongated with an amblyopic eye displaced inferiorly and laterally. There is also a divergent squint of the right eye. The eyebrow is deficient medially and becomes thinned out laterally , where it is contiguous with a broad downward and forward projection of the frontotemporal hairline (this may be seen in both the Number 9 and 10 clefts.) A broad frontal encephalocele bulges forward from the middle one-third of the right forehead, supraorbital ridge, and orbital roof. The bony cleft, through which the frontal encephalocele presents, involves the anterior half of the orbital roof, the supraorbital rim, and two-thirds of the vertical height of the frontal bone lateral to the supraorbital nerve. The bony orbit is inferiorly displaced and widened with the lateral orbital wall shortened and laterally deviated. Similar distortion of the anterior cranial fossa is evident, being broader and more flattened on the affected side. The calvarium above the level of the cleft and the cranial base below is symmetric. [PMID:2503273]
HP:0031583;Tessier number 11 facial cleft;An upper medial orbital cleft produces a cleft of the medial one-third of the upper eyelid that extends through the eyebrow into the frontal hairline. The skeletal element of the cleft in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla may either pass lateral to the ethmoid, through the supraorbital rim, or it may pass through the ethmoidal labyrinth to produce orbital hypertelorism. This cleft usually accompanies the Number 3 cleft. The soft tissue features include a cleft of the medial portion of the upper eyelid, an irregularity in hair orientation at the medial end of the eyebrow, and a long tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline onto the forehead. There is a mild flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla and extensive pneumatization of both the ethmoidal and frontal sinuses, both of which are more prominent on the cleft side. No bony clefting of the supraorbital rim or frontal bone is evident. The cranial base and sphenoid architecture, including the pterygoid processes, are symmetric and normal. [PMID:2503273]
HP:0031584;Tessier number 12 facial cleft;There is a soft tissue cleft medial to the inner canthus with a cleft of the root of the eyebrow. The frontal process of the maxilla is flat and broadened, and the ethmoid labyrinth is increased in tranverse dimension, thereby producing orbital hypertelorism. The cribriform plate is of normal width. The frontal sinus is enlarged. Even though the frontal bone is flattened, bony clefts with encephalocele have not been observed. There is a lateral displacement of the inner canthus with a mild thinning, aplasia, or irregularity of the medial end of the eyebrow. There are no eyelid clefts. The soft tissue contour of the forehead is normal, with only a short downward prolongation of the paramedian frontal hairline to mark the superior extent of the soft tissue cleft. Flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla, an increase in the transverse dimension of the ethmoid sinus, and a laterally convex bowing of the medial orbital wall produce orbital hypertelorism. Superiorly there is a minor flattening of the frontal bone medially, and the nasofrontal angle is somewhat obtuse. The extensive pneumatization of the sinuses on the cleft side extends backward through the frontal and ethmoid sinuses and into the sphenoid sinus. The anatomy of the sphenoid, including the pterygoid processes, is otherwise normal. The anterior and middle cranial fossae floors are both broadened on the cleft side with minor widening of the cribriform plate. [PMID:2503273]
HP:0031585;Tessier number 13 facial cleft;There is a paramedian frontal encephalocele and a soft tissue cleft that passes medial to an intact eyebrow. The frontal bone shows a paramedian bony cleft with an associated encephalocele. The olfactory groove, cribriform plate, and ethmoid sinus are all increased in transverse diameter, resulting in hypertelorism. The cleft extends medially to the undisturbed eyebrow to end in a short paramedian frontal widow's peak. The bony cleft begins in the region of the nasal bone and extends superiorly through the full height of the frontal bone. Posteriorly, the cleft extends through the cribriform plate and ethmoid sinus as far as the lesser wing and body of the sphenoid. The pterygoid processes are anatomically normal, but they are displaced laterally from the midline on the cleft side. There is orbital hypertelorism below and asymmetry of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa above. [PMID:2503273]
HP:0031586;Tessier number 14 facial cleft;This midline cranial cleft usually occurs with a midline facial cleft that completes a median craniofacial dysraphia. A broad nasal root and bifid nose are associated with orbital hypertelorism and a median frontal encephalocele. The frontal bone abnormality varies from a minor flattening to a large midline defect. There is an increased distance between the olfactory grooves. The crista galli is widened, duplicated, or in some cases absent. Marked inferior prolapse of the enlarged ethmoid bone occurs with orbital hypertelorism. The severe orbital hypertelorism is associated with a broad flattening of the glabella and extreme lateral displacement of the inner canthi. The periorbita, including the eyelids and eyebrows, are otherwise normal. A long midline projection of the frontal hairline marks the superior extent of the soft tissue features of this midline cranial cleft. The median frontal defect delineates the region through which the frontal encephalocele herniates. The lateral segments of the frontal bone sweep upward from the region of the intact glabella and are flattened laterally. No pneumatization of the frontal sinus is evident. The crista galli and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid are bifid. Just as the ethmoid, including the cribriform plate, is widened and caudally displaced, the sphenoid sinus is broadened and extensively, but symmetrically pneumatized. The lateral rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid results in a relative shortening of the anteroposterior dimension of the middle cranial fossa. The floor of the anterior cranial fossa is upslanting from its medial aspect to its lateral aspect, with a harlequin appearance on the coronal scan. [PMID:2503273]

HP:0031603;Impaired nasal mucociliary clearance;An abnormally increased amount of time required to clear mucus (and substances contained in the mucus) from the nasal mucosa. The nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC) system functions to transport the mucous layer lining the nasal epithelium towards the naso pharynx by ciliary beating in a metachronous fashion at a frequency of 7-16 Hz. NMC depends upon two principal components: physicochemical qualities and quantities of mucus and the properties of cilia that propel it. NMC is considered to be representative of pulmonary clearance. normal NMC time is determined to be up to 20 minutes. Duration of 30 minutes is considered as the cutoff point that discriminates normal subjects from subjects with impaired NMC. NMC can be measured by determination of the transport time of markers that are placed on the nasal mucosa including saccharine, radioactive markers, and dyes. []

A type V lesion in which the lipid core and other parts of the lesion are calcified may be referred to as type Vb. A type V lesion in which a lipid core is absent and lipid in general is minimal may be referred to as type Vc. With these lesions, arteries are variously narrowed, generally more than with type IV.

These may include differences in composition of the blood, the relative quantities and distributions in the components of the underlying lesion or intima, as well as modifications of shear and tensile forces to which the lesion or intima is exposed.

HP:0031952;Neurogenic claudication;Lumbar spinal stenoses may induce symptoms following an individually typical latency on standing or when walking due to swelling of the cauda equina, which leads to compression. This is referred to as neurogenic claudication. The symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis can be explained by an increase in lumbar lordosis and spinal canal stenosis in an upright position compared to the sitting position or if spondylolisthesis is present by a shift of the vertebrae while standing and walking. Following an individually characteristic distance, walking becomes associated with deep muscular pain and with neurological deficits, such as sensory deficits and paresis in the lower limbs, which resolve within minutes when the affected person sits or lies down. Activities performed in a flexed posture, such as cycling often cause less problems than walking. For the same reason, walking uphill may be tolerated better than walking downhill. Clinical neurological examination at rest may be entirely normal but there is usually pain on hyperextension of the lumbar spine. [PMID:27770207]

HP:0032202;Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia;Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is widely accepted as the precursor lesion of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). VSCC arises via either a human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated pathway, or more commonly, via a mechanism independent of HPV, often being linked to chronic inflammatory conditions such as lichen sclerosus (LS). Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognised: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia. Differentiated VIN, on the other hand, often produces ill-defined lesions, and on histology, notoriously mimics non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (NNED), particularly LS. As a result, dVIN is rarely identified in advance of a diagnosis of invasive malignancy, despite being the precursor lesion of the majority of VSCC. [NCIT:C4756, PMID:30187167]

HP:0032965;Interstitial emphysema;Interstitial emphysema is characterized by air dissecting within the interstitium of the lung, typically in the peribronchovascular sheaths, interlobular septa, and visceral pleura. It is most commonly seen in neonates receiving mechanical ventilation. It is rarely recognized radiographically in adults and is infrequently seen on CT scans. It appears as perivascular lucent or low attenuating halos and small cysts. [LMU:crapp, PMID:18195376]
HP:0032966;Centrilobular emphysema;A type of emphysema characterized by destroyed centrilobular alveolar walls and enlargement of respiratory bronchioles and associated alveoli. This is the commonest form of emphysema in cigarette smokers. CT findings are centrilobular areas of decreased attenuation, usually without visible walls, of nonuniform distribution and predominantly located in upper lung zones.

HP:0032967;Panacinar emphysema;Panacinar emphysema involves all portions of the acinus and secondary pulmonary lobule more or less uniformly. It predominates in the lower lobes and is the form of emphysema associated with1-antitrypsin deficiency. CT scans show a generalized decrease of the lung parenchyma with a decrease in the caliber of blood vessels in the affected lung. Severe panacinar emphysema may coexist and merge with severe centrilobular emphysema. The appearance of feature less decreased attenuation may be indistinguishable from severe constrictive obliterative bronchiolitis. [LMU:mgriese, PMID:1395384, PMID:18195376, PMID:8370825]
HP:0032968;Expiratory air trapping;Abnormal retention of gas within a lung or part of a lung, as a result of airway obstuction of abnormalities in lung compliance. In the classic presentation, the lung will appear normal at inspiration, but on exhalation, the diseased portions of the lung which have lost connective tissue recoil will remain lucent while the healthy portions of the lung will become more dense due to atelectasis. This helps distinguish it from mosaic attenuation due to patchy fibrosis, as occurs with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and in early usual interstitial pneumonitis (the hallmark imaging diagnosis of interstitial lung disease) in which there is no change with inspiration and expiration.

Because of the similar size of secondary lobules, centrilobular nodules often appear to be evenly spaced. Centrilobular nodules are usually separated from the pleural surfaces, fissures, and interlobular septa by a distance of at least several millimeters. They may appear patchy or diffuse in different diseases. [LMU:kknoflach]

HP:0032980;Absent bronchoalveolar surfactant-protein C;Significantly decreased level or failed detection of surfactant protein C in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. Comment: Pulmonary surfactant is a highly surface-active mixture of proteins and lipids that is synthesized and secreted onto the alveoli by type II epithelial cells. The protein part of surfactant constitutes of four types of surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant metabolism and have immunologic functions, whereas SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic molecules, which play a direct role in the organization of the surfactant structure in the interphase and in the stabilization of the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle. Lack of SP-C may result of surfactant metabolism dysfunction and is also observed in patients with other diffuse parenchymal lung diseaes, pathogenetically related to the alveolar surfactant region.

HP:0033552;Chronic villitis;Villitis of unknown etiology (synonymous with villitis of unknown aetiology) is a histologic diagnosis and, although it may have a variable distribution, evidence indicates that 3 parenchymal blocks will identify 62% of villitis, reaching an asymptote of 6 and 7 blocks identifying 85% of villitis. Villitis of unknown etiology by definition excludes those cases where an etiology is identified, such as viral or acute infections, and thus is preferred to the term nonspecific chronic villitis. It is usually lymphohistiocytic: although the presence of rare plasma cells does not exclude the diagnosis, thorough evaluation for an infectious etiology, such as cytomegalovirus, is required in a predominantly plasma cell villitis.

HP:0033580;Compound motor action potential abnormality;An abnormal finding in a compound motor action potential measurement in EMG. Nerve conduction studies involve the application of a depolarising square wave electrical pulses to the skin over a peripheral nerve producing: (1) a propagated nerve action potential (NAP) recorded at a distant point over the same nerve: and (2) a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) arising from the activation of muscle fibres in a target muscle supplied by the nerve. In both cases these may be recorded with surface or needle electrodes. The CMAP is a summated voltage response from the individual muscle fibre action potentials. The shortest latency of the CMAP is the time from stimulus artefact to onset of the response and is a biphasic response with an initial upward deflection followed by a smaller downward deflection. The CMAP amplitude is measured from baseline to negative peak (the neurophysiological convention is that negative voltage is demonstrated by an upward deflection) and measured in millivolts (mV).

HP:0033658;Rounded atelectasis;Rounded atelectasis is rounded collapsed lung associated with invaginated fibrotic pleura and thickened and fibrotic interlobular septa. Most frequently, it is the consequence of an asbestos-induced exudative pleural effusion with resultant pleural scarring, but it may occur with any cause of pleural fibrosis. On chest radiographs, rounded atelectasis appears as a mass abutting a pleural surface, usually in the posterior part of a lower lobe. Distorted vessels have a curvilinear disposition as they converge on the mass (the comet tail sign). The degree of lobar retraction depends on the volume of atelectatic lung. It is almost invariably associated with other signs of pleural fibrosis (eg, blunting of costophrenic angle). CT is more sensitive for the detection and display of the characteristic features of rounded atelectasis. An additional sign is homogeneous uptake of contrast medium in the atelectatic lung.

HP:0033682;Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma;Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA) are rare low-grade astrocytomas (WHO Grade II) typically found in the temporal lobe and classically presenting with epilepsy. PXA is an astrocytic neoplasm that most often presents in children or young adults but can also occur in adults. The diagnosis of anaplastic PXA is made based upon tumor histopathologic characteristics and requires increased proliferative activity (mitotic index at least 5 mitoses/10 HPF), which is associated with worse overall survival. In general, anaplastic PXAs acquire features of a more aggressive astrocytic neoplasm that can include increased proliferation, necrosis, microvascular proliferation, loss of pericellular reticulin, and increased infiltrative growth.

HP:0033849;Bilingual aphasia;"The term bilingual aphasia is used to refer to aphasia in persons who speak two or more languages. When a multilingual speaker has aphasia following a stroke, the languages spoken premorbidly may show comparable or differential patterns of impairment. Differential patterns may manifest as greater impairment in one language compared to another, or as differences in the characteristics of aphasia. Clinical reports of bilingual aphasia show dissociations in the processing of the language learned first (L1) and and second (L2), with one language more impaired than the other. Other cases show a pattern of differential recovery where L2 is recovered only after L1. Another pattern is alternating antagonism; i.e., patients access one language in spontaneous speech and inhibit the other language for alternating periods. This term should be used for a type of aphasia in a person who speaks multiple languages in which the impairment is different for different languages. [PMID:31024369]"

HP:0033987;Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor;A rare, endocrine active tumor that causes severe renal phosphate wasting, which in turn can lead to critical osteomalacia. Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMTs) are typically small and mostly benign tumors producing fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). FGF-23 lowers the expression of sodium/phosphate cotransporters, which are the primary transport proteins responsible for phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys. The paraneoplastic overproduction of FGF-23 lowers reabsorption of phosphate and causes severe paraneoplastic renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia. FGF-23 also affects vitamin D levels by lowering 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the proximal renal tubules and by increasing the expression of vitamin D 24-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for inactivating vitamin D metabolites.

HP:5000034;Anti-Tr/DNER antibody;The presence of autoantibodies (immunoglobulins) in the blood circulation that react against Tr/DNER. Anti-Tr antibodies are directed against cerebellar Purkinje cells (termed anti-Tr or PCA-Tr). Anti-Tr autoantibodies are frequently associated with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Anti-Tr antibodies are defined by a specific staining pattern in cerebellar tissue that is characterized by punctate immunoreactivity in both the dendritic tree and soma of Purkinje cells but not in their axons. This characteristic pattern is indicative of the presence of anti-Tr antibodies. The Delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER) was identified as the target antigen of anti-Tr.
